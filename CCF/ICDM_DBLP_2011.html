<p>【Abstract】:
Dynamic networks have recently being recognized as a powerful abstraction to model and represent the temporal changes and dynamic aspects of the data underlying many complex systems. Significant insights regarding the stable relational patterns among the entities can be gained by analyzing temporal evolution of the complex entity relations. This can help identify the transitions from one conserved state to the next and may provide evidence to the existence of external factors that are responsible for changing the stable relational patterns in these networks. This paper presents a new data mining method that analyzes the time-persistent relations or states between the entities of the dynamic networks and captures all maximal non-redundant evolution paths of the stable relational states. Experimental results based on multiple datasets from real world applications show that the method is efficient and scalable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A configuration management database (CMDB) can be considered to be a large graph representing the IT infrastructure entities and their inter-relationships. Mining such graphs is challenging because they are large, complex, and multi-attributed, and have many repeated labels. These characteristics pose challenges for graph mining algorithms, due to the increased cost of sub graph isomorphism (for support counting), and graph isomorphism (for eliminating duplicate patterns). The notion of pattern frequency or support is also more challenging in a single graph, since it has to be defined in terms of the number of its (potentially, exponentially many) embeddings. We present CMDB-Miner, a novel two-step method for mining infrastructure patterns from CMDB graphs. It first samples the set of maximal frequent patterns, and then clusters them to extract the representative infrastructure patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CMDB-Miner on real-world CMDB graphs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Behavior analysis using trajectory data presents a practical and interesting challenge for KDD. Conventional analyses address discriminative tasks of behaviors, e.g., classification and clustering typically using the subsequences extracted from the trajectory of an object as a numerical feature representation. In this paper, we explore further to identify the difference in the high-level semantics of behaviors such as roles and address the task in a cross-domain learning approach. The trajectory, from which the features are sampled, is intuitively viewed as a domain, and we assume that its intrinsic structure is characterized by the underlying role associated with the tracked object. We propose a novel hybrid method of spectral clustering and density approximation for comparing clustering structures of two independently sampled trajectory data and identifying patterns of behaviors unique to a role. We present empirical evaluations of the proposed method in two practical settings using real-world robotic trajectories.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the problem of using a large amount of unlabeled data to improve the efficiency of feature selection in high dimensional datasets, when only a small set of labeled examples is available. We propose a new semi-supervised feature importance evaluation method (SSFI for short), that combines ideas from co-training and random forests with a new permutation-based out-of-bag feature importance measure. We provide empirical results on several benchmark datasets indicating that SSFI can lead to significant improvement over state-of-the-art semi-supervised and supervised algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
COMET is a single-pass MapReduce algorithm for learning on large-scale data. It builds multiple random forest ensembles on distributed blocks of data and merges them into a mega-ensemble. This approach is appropriate when learning from massive-scale data that is too large to fit on a single machine. To get the best accuracy, IVoting should be used instead of bagging to generate the training subset for each decision tree in the random forest. Experiments with two large datasets (5GB and 50GB compressed) show that COMET compares favorably (in both accuracy and training time) to learning on a sub sample of data using a serial algorithm. Finally, we propose a new Gaussian approach for lazy ensemble evaluation which dynamically decides how many ensemble members to evaluate per data point, this can reduce evaluation cost by 100X or more.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce a new approach to the problem of overlapping clustering. The main idea is to formulate overlapping clustering as an optimization problem in which each data point is mapped to a small set of labels, representing membership to different clusters. The objective is to find a mapping so that the distances between data points agree as much as possible with distances taken over their label sets. To define distances between label sets, we consider two measures: a set-intersection indicator function and the Jaccard coefficient. To solve the main optimization problem we propose a local-search algorithm. The iterative step of our algorithm requires solving non-trivial optimization sub problems, which, for the measures of set-intersection and Jaccard, we solve using a greedy method and non-negative least squares, respectively. Since our frameworks uses pair wise similarities of objects as the input, it lends itself naturally to the task of clustering structured objects for which feature vectors can be difficult to obtain. As a proof of concept we show how easily our framework can be applied in two different complex application domains. Firstly, we develop overlapping clustering of animal trajectories, obtaining zoologically meaningful results. Secondly, we apply our framework for overlapping clustering of proteins based on pair wise similarities of amino acid sequences, outperforming the of state-of-the-art method in matching a ground truth taxonomy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Transductive transfer learning is one special type of transfer learning problem, in which abundant labeled examples are available in the source domain and only unlabeled examples are available in the target domain. It easily finds applications in spam filtering, microblogging mining and so on. In this paper, we propose a general framework to solve the problem by mapping the input features in both the source domain and target domain into a shared latent space and simultaneously minimizing the feature reconstruction loss and prediction loss. We develop one specific example of the framework, namely latent large-margin transductive transfer learning (LATTL) algorithm, and analyze its theoretic bound of classification loss via Rademacher complexity. We also provide a unified view of several popular transfer learning algorithms under our framework. Experiment results on one synthetic dataset and three application datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over the other state-of-the-art ones.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Obtaining an indication of confidence of predictions is desirable for many data mining applications. Such confidence levels, together with the predicted value, can inform on the certainty or extent of reliability that may be associated with the prediction. This can be useful, for example, where model outputs are used in making potentially costly decisions, and one may then focus on the higher confidence predictions, and in general across risk sensitive applications. The conformal prediction framework presents a novel approach for complementing predictions from machine learning algorithms with valid confidence measures. Confidence levels are obtained from the underlying algorithm, using a non-conformity measure which indicates how 'atypical' a given example set is. The non-conformity measure is key to determining the usefulness and efficiency of the approach. This paper considers inductive conformal prediction in the context of random tree ensembles like random forests, which have been noted to perform favorably across problems. Focusing on classification tasks, and considering realistic data contexts including class imbalance, we develop non-conformity measures for assessing the confidence of predicted class labels from random forests. We examine the performance of these measures on multiple datasets. Results demonstrate the usefulness and validity of the measures, their relative differences, and highlight the effectiveness of conformal prediction random forests for obtaining predictions with associated confidence.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Networks from different genres are not static entities, but exhibit dynamic behavior. The congestion level of links in transportation networks varies in time depending on the traffic. Similarly, social and communication links are employed at varying rates as information cascades unfold. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in modeling and mining dynamic networks. However, limited attention has been placed in high-scoring sub graph discovery in time-evolving networks. We define the problem of finding the highest-scoring temporal sub graph in a dynamic network, termed Heaviest Dynamic Sub graph (HDS). We show that HDS is NP-hard even with edge weights in {-1,1} and devise an efficient approach for large graph instances that evolve over long time periods. While a naive approach would enumerate all O(t<sup>2</sup>) sub-intervals, our solution performs an effective pruning of the sub-interval space by considering O(t&#x00B7;log(t)) groups of sub-intervals and computing an aggregate of each group in logarithmic time. We also define a fast heuristic and a tight upper bound for approximating the static version of HDS, and use them for further pruning the sub-interval space and quickly verifying candidate sub-intervals. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on transportation, communication and social media networks for discovering sub graphs that correspond to traffic congestions, communication overflow and localized social discussions. Our method is two orders of magnitude faster than a naive approach and scales well with network size and time length.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Feature selection is an essential component of data mining. In many data analysis tasks where the number of data point is much less than the number of features, efficient feature selection approaches are desired to extract meaningful features and to eliminate redundant ones. In the previous study, many data mining techniques have been applied to tackle the above challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new &#x2113;<sub>2,1</sub>-norm SVM, that is, multi-class hinge loss with a structured regularization term for all the classes to naturally select features for multi-class without bothering further heuristic strategy. Rather than directly solving the multi-class hinge loss with &#x2113;<sub>2,1</sub>-norm regularization minimization, which has not been solved before due to its optimization difficulty, we are the first to give an efficient algorithm bridging the new problem with a previous solvable optimization problem to do multi-class feature selection. A global convergence proof for our method is also presented. Via the proposed efficient algorithm, we select features across multiple classes with jointly sparsity, i.e., each feature has either small or large score over all classes. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on six bioinformatics data sets to show that our method can obtain better or competitive performance compared with exiting state-of-art multi-class feature selection approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Documents in rich text corpora often contain multiple facets of information. For example, an article from a medical document collection might consist of multifaceted information about symptoms, treatments, causes, diagnoses, prognoses, and preventions. Thus, documents in the collection may have different relations across each of these various facets. Topic analysis and exploration for such multi-relational corpora is a challenging visual analytic task. This paper presents Solar Map, a multifaceted visual analytic technique for visually exploring topics in multi-relational data. Solar Map simultaneously visualizes the topic distribution of the underlying entities from one facet together with keyword distributions that convey the semantic definition of each cluster along a secondary facet. Solar Map combines several visual techniques including 1) topic contour clusters and interactive multifaceted keyword topic rings, 2) a global layout optimization algorithm that aligns each topic cluster with its corresponding keywords, and 3) 2) an optimal temporal network segmentation and layout method that renders temporal evolution of clusters. Finally, the paper concludes with two case studies and quantitative user evaluation which show the power of the Solar Map technique.</p>

Frequent tree patterns have many applications in different domains such as XML document mining, user web log analysis, network routing and bioinformatics. In this paper, we first introduce three new tree encodings and accordingly present an efficient algorithm for finding frequent patterns from rooted unordered trees with the assumption that children of every node in database trees are identically labeled. Then, we generalize the method and propose the UITree algorithm to find frequent patterns from rooted unordered trees without any restriction. Compared to other algorithms in the literature, UItree manages occurrences of a candidate tree in database trees more efficiently. Our extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show that UITree significantly outperforms the most efficient existing works on mining unordered trees.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The mining of closed sequential patterns has attracted researchers for its capability of using compact results to preserve the same expressive power as conventional mining. However, existing studies only focus on time point-based data. Few research efforts have elaborated on discovering closed sequential patterns from time interval-based data, where each data persists for a period of time. Mining closed time interval-based patterns, also called closed temporal patterns, is an arduous problem since the pair wise relationships between two interval-based events are intrinsically complex. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, CEMiner is developed to discover closed temporal patterns from interval-based data. Algorithm CEMiner employs some optimization techniques to effectively reduce the search space. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that CEMiner not only significantly outperforms the prior interval-based mining algorithms in terms of execution time but also possesses graceful scalability. The experiment conducted on real dataset shows the practicability of time interval-based closed pattern mining.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Link prediction is a challenging task due to the inherent skew ness of network data. Typical link prediction methods can be categorized as either local or global. Local methods consider the link structure in the immediate neighborhood of a node pair to determine the presence or absence of a link, whereas global methods utilize information from the whole network. This paper presents a community (cluster) level link prediction method without the need to explicitly identify the communities in a network. Specifically, a variable-cost loss function is defined to address the data skew ness problem. We provide theoretical proof that shows the equivalence between maximizing the well-known modularity measure used in community detection and minimizing a special case of the proposed loss function. As a result, any link prediction method designed to optimize the loss function would result in more links being predicted within a community than between communities. We design a boosting algorithm to minimize the loss function and present an approach to scale-up the algorithm by decomposing the network into smaller partitions and aggregating the weak learners constructed from each partition. Experimental results show that our proposed Link Boost algorithm consistently performs as good as or better than many existing methods when evaluated on 4 real-world network datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Motivated by the task of vernacular news analysis using known news topics from national news-papers, we study the task of topic analysis, where given source datasets with observed topics, data items from a target dataset need to be assigned either to observed source topics or to new ones. Using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes for addressing this task imposes unnecessary and often inappropriate generative assumptions on the observed source topics. In this paper, we explore Dirichlet Processes with partially observed groups (POG-DP). POG-DP avoids modeling the given source topics. Instead, it directly models the conditional distribution of the target data as a mixture of a Dirichlet Process and the posterior distribution of a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process with known groups and topics. This introduces coupling between selection probabilities of all topics within a source, leading to effective identification of source topics. We further improve on this with a Combinatorial Dirichlet Process with partially observed groups (POG-CDP) that captures finer grained coupling between related topics by choosing intersections between sources. We evaluate our models in three different real-world applications. Using extensive experimentation, we compare against several baselines to show that our model performs significantly better in all three applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Subgroup discovery suffers from the multiple comparisons problem: we search through a large space, hence whenever we report a set of discoveries, this set will generally contain false discoveries. We propose a method to compare subgroups found through subgroup discovery with a statistical model we build for these false discoveries. We determine how much the subgroups we find deviate from the model, and hence statistically validate the found subgroups. Furthermore we propose to use this subgroup validation to objectively compare quality measures used in subgroup discovery, by determining how much the top subgroups we find with each measure deviate from the statistical model generated with that measure. We thus aim to determine how good individual measures are in selecting significant findings. We invoke our method to experimentally compare popular quality measures in several subgroup discovery settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In data mining applications, data instances are typically described by a huge number of features. Most of these features are irrelevant or redundant, which negatively affects the efficiency and effectiveness of different learning algorithms. The selection of relevant features is a crucial task which can be used to allow a better understanding of data or improve the performance of other learning tasks. Although the selection of relevant features has been extensively studied in supervised learning, feature selection with the absence of class labels is still a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised feature selection, which efficiently selects features in a greedy manner. The paper first defines an effective criterion for unsupervised feature selection which measures the reconstruction error of the data matrix based on the selected subset of features. The paper then presents a novel algorithm for greedily minimizing the reconstruction error based on the features selected so far. The greedy algorithm is based on an efficient recursive formula for calculating the reconstruction error. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised feature selection.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-task Learning (MTL) aims to enhance the generalization performance of supervised regression or classification by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to extend the current MTL techniques to high dimensional data sets with structured input and structured output (SISO), where the SI means the input features are structured and the SO means the tasks are structured. We investigate a completely ignored problem in MTL with SISO data: the interaction of structured feature selection and task relationship modeling. We hypothesize that combining the structure information of features and task relationship inference enables us to build more accurate MTL models. Based on the hypothesis, we have designed an efficient learning algorithm, in which we utilize a task covariance matrix related to the model parameters to capture the task relationship. In addition, we design a regularization formulation for incorporating the structure of features in MTL. We have developed an efficient iterative optimization algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on the accelerated first order gradient method in conjunction with the projected gradient scheme. Using two real-world data sets, the experimental results demonstrate the utility of the proposed learning methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Advances in GPS tracking technology have enabled us to install GPS tracking devices in city taxis to collect a large amount of GPS traces under operational time constraints. These GPS traces provide unparallel opportunities for us to uncover taxi driving fraud activities. In this paper, we develop a taxi driving fraud detection system, which is able to systematically investigate taxi driving fraud. In this system, we first provide functions to find two aspects of evidences: travel route evidence and driving distance evidence. Furthermore, a third function is designed to combine the two aspects of evidences based on Dempster-Shafer theory. To implement the system, we first identify interesting sites from a large amount of taxi GPS logs. Then, we propose a parameter-free method to mine the travel route evidences. Also, we introduce route mark to represent a typical driving path from an interesting site to another one. Based on route mark, we exploit a generative statistical model to characterize the distribution of driving distance and identify the driving distance evidences. Finally, we evaluate the taxi driving fraud detection system with large scale real-world taxi GPS logs. In the experiments, we uncover some regularity of driving fraud activities and investigate the motivation of drivers to commit a driving fraud by analyzing the produced taxi fraud data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Semi-supervised learning based on manifolds has been the focus of extensive research in recent years. Convenient neighbourhood graph construction is a key component of a successful semi-supervised classification method. Previous graph construction methods fail when there are pairs of data points that have small Euclidean distance, but are far apart over the manifold. To overcome this problem, we start with an arbitrary neighbourhood graph and iteratively update the edge weights by using the estimates of the geodesic distances between points. Moreover, we provide theoretical bounds on the values of estimated geodesic distances. Experimental results on real-world data show significant improvement compared to the previous graph construction methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Community detection and evaluation is an important task in graph mining. In many cases, a community is defined as a sub graph characterized by dense connections or interactions among its nodes. A large variety of measures have been proposed to evaluate the quality of such communities - in most cases ignoring the directed nature of edges. In this paper, we introduce novel metrics for evaluating the collaborative nature of directed graphs - a property not captured by the single node metrics or by other established community evaluation metrics. In order to accomplish this objective, we capitalize on the concept of graph degeneracy and define a novel D-core framework, extending the classic graph-theoretic notion of k-cores for undirected graphs to directed ones. Based on the D-core, which essentially can be seen as a measure of the robustness of a community under degeneracy, we devise a wealth of novel metrics used to evaluate graph collaboration features of directed graphs. We applied the D-core approach on large real-world graphs such as Wikipedia and DBLP and report interesting results at the graph as well at node level.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There is significant current interest in the problem of influence maximization: given a directed social network with influence weights on edges and a number k, find k seed nodes such that activating them leads to the maximum expected number of activated nodes, according to a propagation model. Kempe et al. showed, among other things, that under the Linear Threshold Model, the problem is NP-hard, and that a simple greedy algorithm guarantees the best possible approximation factor in PTIME. However, this algorithm suffers from various major performance drawbacks. In this paper, we propose SIMPATH, an efficient and effective algorithm for influence maximization under the linear threshold model that addresses these drawbacks by incorporating several clever optimizations. Through a comprehensive performance study on four real data sets, we show that SIMPATH consistently outperforms the state of the art w.r.t. running time, memory consumption and the quality of the seed set chosen, measured in terms of expected influence spread achieved.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Understanding search intents of users through their condensed short queries has attracted much attention both in academia and industry. The search intents of users are generally assumed to be associated with various query patterns, such as "MobileName price", where "MobileName" could be any named entity of mobile phone model and this pattern indicates that the user intends to buy a mobile phone. However, discovering the query intent patterns for general search is challenging mainly due to the difficulty in collecting sufficient training data for learning query patterns across a large number of searchable domains. In this work, we propose Cross Domain Random Walk (CDRW) algorithm, which is semi-supervised, to discover the query intent patterns across different domains from search engine click-through log data. Starting with some manually tagged seed queries in one or more independent domains, CDRW takes the query patterns as bridge and propagates the transition probability across domains to collect the query intent patterns among different domains based on the assumption that "users who have similar intent in different but similar domains will have high probability to share similar query patterns across domains". Different from classical random walk algorithms, CDRW walks across different domains to disseminate the shared knowledge in a transfer learning manner. Extensive experiment results on real log data of a commercial search engine well validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In today's applications, data analysis tasks are hindered by many attributes per object as well as by faulty data with missing values. Subspace clustering tackles the challenge of many attributes by cluster detection in any subspace projection of the data. However, it poses novel challenges for handling missing values of objects, which are part of multiple subspace clusters in different projections of the data. In this work, we propose a general fault tolerance definition enhancing subspace clustering models to handle missing values. We introduce a flexible notion of fault tolerance that adapts to the individual characteristics of subspace clusters and ensures a robust parameterization. Allowing missing values in our model increases the computational complexity of subspace clustering. Thus, we prove novel monotonicity properties for an efficient computation of fault tolerant subspace clusters. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our fault tolerance model yields high quality results even in the presence of many missing values. For repeatability, we provide all datasets and executables on our website.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning in non-stationary environments is an increasingly important problem in a wide variety of real-world applications. In non-stationary environments data arrives incrementally, however the underlying generating function may change over time. While there is a variety of research into such environments, the research mainly consists of detecting concept drift (and then relearning the model), or developing classifiers which adapt to drift incrementally. We introduce Heuristic Up datable Weighted Random Subspaces (HUWRS), a new technique based on the Random Subspace Method that detects drift in individual features via the use of Hellinger distance, a distributional divergence metric. Through the use of subspaces, HUWRS allows for a more fine-grained approach to dealing with concept drift which is robust to feature drift even without class labels. We then compare our approach to two state of the art algorithms, concluding that for a wide range of datasets and window sizes HUWRS outperforms the other methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Providing methods to support semantic interaction with growing volumes of video data is an increasingly important challenge for data mining. To this end, there has been some success in recognition of simple objects and actions in video, however most of this work requires strongly supervised training data. The supervision cost of these approaches therefore renders them economically non-scalable for real world applications. In this paper we address the problem of learning to annotate and retrieve semantic tags of human actions in realistic video data with sparsely provided tags of semantically salient activities. This is challenging because of (1) the multi-label nature of the learning problem and (2) realistic videos are often dominated by (semantically uninteresting) background activity un-supported by any tags of interest, leading to a strong irrelevant data problem. To address these challenges, we introduce a new topic model based approach to video tag annotation. Our model simultaneously learns a low dimensional representation of the video data, which dimensions are semantically relevant (supported by tags), and how to annotate videos with tags. Experimental evaluation on three different video action/activity datasets demonstrate the challenge of this problem, and value of our contribution.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Though news readers can easily access a large number of news articles from the Internet, they can be overwhelmed by the quantity of information available, making it hard to get a concise, global picture of a news topic. In this paper we propose a novel method to address this problem. Given a set of articles for a given news topic, the proposed method models theme variation through time and identifies the breakpoints, which are time points when decisive changes occur. For each breakpoint, a brief summary is automatically constructed based on articles associated with the particular time point. Summaries are then ordered chronologically to form a timeline overview of the news topic. In this fashion, readers can easily track various news topics efficiently. We have conducted experiments on 15 popular topics in 2010. Empirical experiments show the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over other approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Current spectral clustering algorithms suffer from both sensitivity to scaling parameter selection in similarity matrix construction, and data perturbation. This paper aims to improve robustness in clustering algorithms and combat these two limitations based on heat kernel theory. Heat kernel can statistically depict traces of random walk, so it has an intrinsic connection with diffusion distance, with which we can ensure robustness during any clustering process. By integrating heat distributed along time scale, we propose a novel method called Aggregated Heat Kernel (AHK) to measure the distance between each point pair in their eigen space. Using AHK and Laplace-Beltrami Normalization (LBN) we are able to apply an advanced noise-resisting robust spectral mapping to original dataset. Moreover it offers stability on scaling parameter tuning. Experimental results show that, compared to other popular spectral clustering methods, our algorithm can achieve robust clustering results on both synthetic and UCI real datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Patents are of crucial importance for businesses, because they provide legal protection for the invented techniques, processes or products. A patent can be held for up to 20 years. However, large maintenance fees need to be paid to keep it enforceable. If the patent is deemed not valuable, the owner may decide to abandon it by stopping paying the maintenance fees to reduce the cost. For large companies or organizations, making such decisions is difficult because too many patents need to be investigated. In this paper, we introduce the new patent mining problem of automatic patent maintenance prediction, and propose a systematic solution to analyze patents for recommending patent maintenance decision. We model the patents as a heterogeneous time-evolving information network and propose new patent features to build model for a ranked prediction on whether to maintain or abandon a patent. In addition, a network-based refinement approach is proposed to further improve the performance. We have conducted experiments on the large scale United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database which contains over four million granted patents. The results show that our technique can achieve high performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The growing gap between the massive amounts of data generated by petascale scientific simulation codes and the capability of system hardware and software to effectively analyze this data necessitates data reduction. Yet, the increasing data complexity challenges most, if not all, of the existing data compression methods. In fact, lossless compression techniques offer no more than 10% reduction on scientific data that we have experience with, which is widely regarded as effectively incompressible. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we advocate a transformative strategy that enables fast, accurate, and multi-fold reduction of double-precision floating-point scientific data. The intuition behind our method is inspired by an effective use of preconditioners for linear algebra solvers optimized for a particular class of computational "dwarfs" (e.g., dense or sparse matrices). Focusing on a commonly used multi-resolution wavelet compression technique as the underlying "solver" for data reduction we propose the S-preconditioner, which transforms scientific data into a form with high global regularity to ensure a significant decrease in the number of wavelet coefficients stored for a segment of data. Combined with the subsequent EQ-calibrator, our resultant method (called S-Preconditioned EQ-Calibrated Wavelets (SPEQC-Wavelets)), robustly achieved a 4- to 5-fold data reduction-while guaranteeing user-defined accuracy of reconstructed data to be within 1% point-by-point relative error, lower than 0.01 Normalized RMSE, and higher than 0.99 Pearson Correlation. In this paper, we show the results we obtained by testing our method on six petascale simulation codes including fusion, combustion, climate, astrophysics, and subsurface groundwater in addition to 13 publicly available scientific datasets.

<p>【Abstract】:
Given a real world graph, how should we lay-out its edges? How can we compress it? These questions are closely related, and the typical approach so far is to find clique-like communities, like the <code>cavemen graph', and compress them. We show that the block-diagonal mental image of the</code>cavemen graph' is the wrong paradigm, in full agreement with earlier results that real world graphs have no good cuts. Instead, we propose to envision graphs as a collection of hubs connecting spokes, with super-hubs connecting the hubs, and so on, recursively. Based on the idea, we propose the Slash Burn method (burn the hubs, and slash the remaining graph into smaller connected components). Our view point has several advantages: (a) it avoids the `no good cuts' problem, (b) it gives better compression, and (c) it leads to faster execution times for matrix-vector operations, which are the back-bone of most graph processing tools. Experimental results show that our Slash Burn method consistently outperforms other methods on all datasets, giving good compression and faster running time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Product classification in Commerce search (e.g., Google Product Search, Bing Shopping) involves associating categories to offers of products from a large number of merchants. The categorized offers are used in many tasks including product taxonomy browsing and matching merchant offers to products in the catalog. Hence, learning a product classifier with high precision and recall is of fundamental importance in order to provide high quality shopping experience. A product offer typically consists of a short textual description and an image depicting the product. Traditional approaches to this classification task is to learn a classifier using only the textual descriptions of the products. In this paper, we show that the use of images, a weaker signal in our setting, in conjunction with the textual descriptions, a more discriminative signal, can considerably improve the precision of the classification task, irrespective of the type of classifier being used. We present a novel classification approach, Confusion Driven Probabilistic Fusion++ (CDPF++), that is cognizant of the disparity in the discriminative power of different types of signals and hence makes use of the confusion matrix of dominant signal (text in our setting) to prudently leverage the weaker signal (image), for an improved performance. Our evaluation performed on data from a major Commerce search engine's catalog shows a 12% (absolute) improvement in precision at 100% coverage, and a 16% (absolute) improvement in recall at 90% precision compared to classifiers that only use textual description of products. In addition, CDPF++ also provides a more accurate classifier based only on the dominant signal (text) that can be used in situations in which only the dominant signal is available during application time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent years have seen a surge of interest in Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models that combine logic with probabilities. One prominent example is Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). While MLNs are indeed highly expressive, this expressiveness comes at a cost. Learning MLNs is a hard problem and therefore has attracted much interest in the SRL community. Current methods for learning MLNs follow a two-step approach: first, perform a search through the space of possible clauses and then learn appropriate weights for these clauses. We propose to take a different approach, namely to learn both the weights and the structure of the MLN simultaneously. Our approach is based on functional gradient boosting where the problem of learning MLNs is turned into a series of relational functional approximation problems. We use two kinds of representations for the gradients: clause-based and tree-based. Our experimental evaluation on several benchmark data sets demonstrates that our new approach can learn MLNs as good or better than those found with state-of-the-art methods, but often in a fraction of the time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Pattern mining is a fundamental problem that has a wide range of applications. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a minimum set of signature patterns that explain all data. In the problem, we are given objects where each object has an item set and a label. A pattern is called a signature pattern if all objects with the pattern have the same label. This problem has many interesting applications such as assertion mining in hardware design and identifying failure causes from various log data. We show that the previous pattern mining methods are not suitable for mining signature patterns and identify the problems. Then we propose a novel pattern enumeration method which we call Pattern Shrink. Our method is strongly coupled with another novel method that is very similar to finding a local optimum with a negligible loss in performance. Our proposed methods show a speedup of more than ten times over the previous methods. Our methods are flexible enough to be extended to mining high confidence patterns, instead of signature patterns.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Twitter provides search services to help people find new users to follow by recommending popular users or their friends' friends. However, these services do not offer the most relevant users to follow for a user. Furthermore, Twitter does not provide yet the search services to find the most interesting tweet messages for a user either. In this paper, we propose TWITOBI, a recommendation system for Twitter using probabilistic modeling for collaborative filtering which can recommend top-K users to follow and top-K tweets to read for a user. Our novel probabilistic model utilizes not only tweet messages but also the relationships between users. We develop an estimation algorithm for learning our model parameters and present its parallelized algorithm using MapReduce to handle large data. Our performance study with real-life data sets confirms the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Statistical assessment of the results of data mining is increasingly recognised as a core task in the knowledge discovery process. It is of key importance in practice, as results that might seem interesting at first glance can often be explained by well-known basic properties of the data. In pattern mining, for instance, such trivial results can be so overwhelming in number that filtering them out is a necessity in order to identify the truly interesting patterns. In this paper, we propose an approach for assessing results on real-valued rectangular databases. More specifically, using our analytical model we are able to statistically assess whether or not a discovered structure may be the trivial result of the row and column marginal distributions in the database. Our main approach is to use the Maximum Entropy principle to fit a background model to the data while respecting its marginal distributions. To find these distributions, we employ an MDL based histogram estimator, and we fit these in our model using efficient convex optimization techniques. Subsequently, our model can be used to calculate probabilities directly, as well as to efficiently sample data with the purpose of assessing results by means of empirical hypothesis testing. Notably, our approach is efficient, parameter-free, and naturally deals with missing values. As such, it represents a well-founded alternative to swap randomisation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Subgroup discovery (also known as Pattern Mining or Supervised Descriptive Rule Discovery) searches for descriptions of subsets in a dataset that differ from the total population with respect to a given target concept. In this paper we argue that in the traditional approach potentially interesting complex patterns with an unexpected relative increase of the target share remain undiscovered while on the other hand less surprising patterns are returned. Therefore, we present a generalized approach on subgroup discovery, in which the target share in the subgroup is not compared to the target share in the total population, but to the expectations a user has given the knowledge of more general (simpler) patterns. We claim that the resulting complex patterns are more interesting for the user and are less biased towards simpler patterns with a positive influence on the target concept. In order to estimate these expectations we utilize local models, i.e., fragments of Bayesian Networks. The proposed approach is evaluated using data from the UCI repository as well as on two totally different real world applications that investigate university student drop-out rates and identify spammers in a social book marking system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-instance learning (MIL), a variant of supervised learning framework, has been applied in many applications. More recently, researchers focus on two important issues for MIL: Instances' contextual structures representation in the same bag and online MIL schemes. In this paper, we present an effective context-aware multi-instance learning technique using a hierarchical sparse representation (HSR-MIL) that addresses the two challenges simultaneously. We firstly construct the inner contextual structure among instances in the same bag based on a novel sparse &#x03B5;-graph. We then propose a graph kernel based sparse bag classifier through a modified kernel sparse coding in higher-dimension feature space. At last, the HSR-MIL approach is extended to achieve online learning manner with an incremental kernel matrix update scheme. The experiments on several data sets demonstrate that our method has better performances and online learning ability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The prevalence of Web 2.0 techniques has led to the boom of various online communities, where topics spread ubiquitously among user-generated documents. Working together with this diffusion process is the evolution of topic content, where novel contents are introduced by documents which adopt the topic. Unlike explicit user behavior (e.g., buying a DVD), both the diffusion paths and the evolutionary process of a topic are implicit, making their discovery challenging. In this paper, we track the evolution of an arbitrary topic and reveal the latent diffusion paths of that topic in a social community. A novel and principled probabilistic model is proposed which casts our task as an joint inference problem, which considers textual documents, social influences, and topic evolution in a unified way. Specifically, a mixture model is introduced to model the generation of text according to the diffusion and the evolution of the topic, while the whole diffusion process is regularized with user-level social influences through a Gaussian Markov Random Field. Experiments on both synthetic data and real world data show that the discovery of topic diffusion and evolution benefits from this joint inference, and the probabilistic model we propose performs significantly better than existing methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we investigate how to design an optimized discriminating order for boosting multiclass classification. The main idea is to optimize a binary tree architecture, referred to as Sequential Discriminating Tree (SDT), that performs the multiclass classification through a hierarchical sequence of coarse-to-fine binary classifiers. To infer such a tree architecture, we employ the constrained large margin clustering procedure which enforces samples belonging to the same class to locate at the same side of the hyper plane while maximizing the margin between these two partitioned class subsets. The proposed SDT algorithm has a theoretic error bound which is shown experimentally to effectively guarantee the generalization performance. Experiment results indicate that SDT clearly beats the state-of-the-art multiclass classification algorithms.</p>

In this paper, we address an interesting data mining problem of finding semantically associated itemsets, i.e., items connected via indirect links. We propose a novel method for discovering semantically associated itemsets based on a hypergraph representation of the database. We describe two similarity measures to compute the strength of associations between items. Specifically, we introduce the average commute time similarity, s<sub>CT</sub>, based on the random walk model on hypergraph, and the inner-product similarity, s<sub>L+</sub>, based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the hypergraph Laplacian matrix. Given semantically associated 2-itemsets generated by these measures, we design a hypergraph expansion method with two search strategies, namely, the clique and connected component search, to generate k-itemsets (k &gt;; 2). We show the proposed method is indeed capable of capturing semantically associated itemsets through experiments performed on three datasets ranging from low to high dimensionality. The semantically associated itemsets discovered in our experiment is promising to provide valuable insights on interrelationship between medical concepts and other domain specific concepts.</p>

As the worlds of commerce, entertainment, travel, and Internet technology become more inextricably linked, new types of business data become available for creative use and formal analysis. Indeed, this paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To this end, we first analyze the characteristics of the travel packages and develop a Tourist-Area-Season Topic (TAST) model, which can extract the topics conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e. locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Based on this TAST model, we propose a cocktail approach on personalized travel package recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model and the cocktail approach on real-world travel package data. The experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is thus much more effective than traditional recommendation methods for travel package recommendation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, there has been extensive research towards the user-provided tags on photo sharing websites which can greatly facilitate image retrieval and management. However, due to the arbitrariness of the tagging activities, these tags are often imprecise and incomplete. As a result, quite a few technologies has been proposed to improve the user experience on these photo sharing systems, including tag clustering and refinement, etc. In this work, we propose a novel framework to model the relationships among tags and images which can be applied to many tag based applications. Different from previous approaches which model images and tags as heterogeneous objects, images and their tags are uniformly viewed as compositions of Semantic Unities in our framework. Then Semantic Unity Graph (SUG) is introduced to represent the complex and high-order relationships among these Semantic Unities. Based on the representation of Semantic Unity Graph, the relevance of images and tags can be naturally measured in terms of the similarity of their Semantic Unities. Then Tag clustering and refinement can then be performed on SUG and the polysemy of images and tags is explicitly considered in this framework. The experiment results conducted on NUS-WIDE and MIR-Flickr datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Viral marketing has attracted considerable concerns in recent years due to its novel idea of leveraging the social network to propagate the awareness of products. Specifically, viral marketing is to first target a limited number of users (seeds) in the social network by providing incentives, and these targeted users would then initiate the process of awareness spread by propagating the information to their friends via their social relationships. Extensive studies have been conducted for maximizing the awareness spread given the number of seeds. However, all of them fail to consider the common scenario of viral marketing where companies hope to use as few seeds as possible yet influencing at least a certain number of users. In this paper, we propose a new problem, called J-MIN-Seed, whose objective is to minimize the number of seeds while at least J users are influenced. J-MIN-Seed, unfortunately, is proved to be NP-hard in this work. In such case, we develop a greedy algorithm that can provide error guarantees for J-MIN-Seed. Furthermore, for the problem setting where J is equal to the number of all users in the social network, denoted by Full-Coverage, we design other efficient algorithms. Extensive experiments were conducted on real datasets to verify our algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
To understand how social networks evolve over time, graphs representing the networks need to be published periodically or on-demand. The identity of the participants (nodes) must be anonymized to protect the privacy of the individuals and their relationships (edges) to the other members in the social network. We identify a new form of privacy attack, which we name the degree-trail attack. This attack re-identifies the nodes belonging to a target participant from a sequence of published graphs by comparing the degree of the nodes in the published graphs with the degree evolution of a target. The power of this attack is that the adversary can actively influence the degree of the target individual by interacting with the social network. We show that the adversary can succeed with a high probability even if published graphs are anonymized by strongest known privacy preserving techniques in the literature. Moreover, this success does not depend on the distinctiveness of the target nodes nor require the adversary to behave differently from a normal participant. One of our contributions is a formal method to assess the privacy risk of this type of attacks and empirically study the severity on real social network data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tensors are multi-way generalizations of matrices, and similarly to matrices, they can also be factorized, that is, represented (approximately) as a product of factors. These factors are typically either all matrices or a mixture of matrices and tensors. With the widespread adoption of matrix factorization techniques in data mining, also tensor factorizations have started to gain attention. In this paper we study the Boolean tensor factorizations. We assume that the data is binary multi-way data, and we want to factorize it to binary factors using Boolean arithmetic (i.e. defining that 1+1=1). Boolean tensor factorizations are, therefore, natural generalization of the Boolean matrix factorizations. We will study the theory of Boolean tensor factorizations and show that at least some of the benefits Boolean matrix factorizations have over normal matrix factorizations carry over to the tensor data. We will also present algorithms for Boolean variations of CP and Tucker decompositions, the two most-common types of tensor factorizations. With experimentation done with synthetic and real-world data, we show that Boolean tensor factorizations are a viable alternative when the data is naturally binary.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address the problem of domain adaptation for binary classification which arises when the distributions generating the source learning data and target test data are somewhat different. We consider the challenging case where no target labeled data is available. From a theoretical standpoint, a classifier has better generalization guarantees when the two domain marginal distributions are close. We study a new direction based on a recent framework of Balcan et al. allowing to learn linear classifiers in an explicit projection space based on similarity functions that may be not symmetric and not positive semi-definite. We propose a general method for learning a good classifier on target data with generalization guarantees and we improve its efficiency thanks to an iterative procedure by reweighting the similarity function - compatible with Balcan et al. framework - to move closer the two distributions in a new projection space. Hyper parameters and reweighting quality are controlled by a reverse validation procedure. Our approach is based on a linear programming formulation and shows good adaptation performances with very sparse models. We evaluate it on a synthetic problem and on real image annotation task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) provide a low cost option for gathering spatially dense data from different environments. However, WSNs have limited energy resources that hinder the dissemination of the raw data over the network to a central location. This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical results on both real-life and simulated data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Finding ways of incorporating auxiliary information or auxiliary data into the learning process has been the topic of active data mining and machine learning research in recent years. In this work we study and develop a new framework for classification learning problem in which, in addition to class labels, the learner is provided with an auxiliary (probabilistic) information that reflects how strong the expert feels about the class label. This approach can be extremely useful for many practical classification tasks that rely on subjective label assessment and where the cost of acquiring additional auxiliary information is negligible when compared to the cost of the example analysis and labelling. We develop classification algorithms capable of using the auxiliary information to make the learning process more efficient in terms of the sample complexity. We demonstrate the benefit of the approach on a number of synthetic and real world data sets by comparing it to the learning with class labels only.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In centroid-based classification, each class is represented by a prototype or centroid document vector that is formed by averaging all member vectors during the training phase. In the prediction phase, the label of a test document vector is assigned to that of its nearest class prototype. Recently there has been revived interest in reformulating the prototype/centroid to improve classification performance. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the recently proposed Class Feature Centroid (CFC) classifier by considering the rate of change of each prototype vector with respect to individual dimensions (terms). The implication of our theoretical finding is that CFC is inherently biased towards large (dominant majority) classes, which means it is destined to perform poorly for highly class-imbalanced data. Another practical concern about CFC lies in its overly-aggressive design in weeding out terms that appear in all classes. To overcome these CFC limitations while retaining its intrinsic and worthy design goals, we propose an improved and robust centroid-based classifier that uses precise term-class distribution properties instead of simple presence or absence of terms in classes. Specifically, terms are weighted based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure between pairs of class-conditional term probabilities, we call this the CFC-KL centroid classifier. We then generalized CFC-KL to handle multi-class data by summing pair wise class-conditioned word probability ratios. Our proposed approach has been evaluated on 5 datasets, on which it consistently outperforms CFC and the baseline Support Vector Machine classifier. We also devise a word cloud visualization approach to highlight the important class-specific words picked out by our CFC-KL, and visually compare it with other popular term weigthing approaches. Our encouraging results show that the centroid based generalized CFC-KL classifier is both robust and efficient to deal with real-world text c- assification.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper focuses on developing effective and efficient algorithms for top-N recommender systems. A novel Sparse Linear Method (SLIM) is proposed, which generates top-N recommendations by aggregating from user purchase/rating profiles. A sparse aggregation coefficient matrix W is learned from SLIM by solving an &#x2113;<sub>1</sub>-norm and &#x2113;<sub>2</sub>-norm regularized optimization problem. W is demonstrated to produce high quality recommendations and its sparsity allows SLIM to generate recommendations very fast. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted by comparing the SLIM method and other state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods. The experiments show that SLIM achieves significant improvements both in run time performance and recommendation quality over the best existing methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, novel recommender systems have attracted considerable attention in the research community. Recommending popular items may not always satisfy users. For example, although most users likely prefer popular items, such items are often not very surprising or novel because users may already know about the items. Also, such recommender systems hardly satisfy a group of users who prefer relatively obscure items. Existing novel recommender systems, however, still recommend mainly popular items or degrade the quality of recommendation. They do so because they do not consider the balance between novelty and preference-based recommendation. This paper proposes an efficient novel-recommendation method called Personal Popularity Tendency Matching (PPTM) which recommends novel items by considering an individual's Personal Popularity Tendency (or PPT). Considering PPT helps to diversify recommendations by reasonably penalizing popular items while improving the recommendation accuracy. We experimentally show that the proposed method, PPTM, is better than other methods in terms of both novelty and accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
If one is given two binary classifiers and a set of test data, it should be straightforward to determine which of the two classifiers is the superior. Recent work, however, has called into question many of the methods heretofore accepted as standard for this task. In this paper, we analyze seven ways of determining if one classifier is better than another, given the same test data. Five of these are long established and two are relative newcomers. We review and extend work showing that one of these methods is clearly inappropriate, and then conduct an empirical analysis with a large number of datasets to evaluate the real-world implications of our theoretical analysis. Both our empirical and theoretical results converge strongly towards one of the newer methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We identify and formulate a novel problem: cross channel anomaly detection from multiple data channels. Cross channel anomalies are common amongst the individual channel anomalies, and are often portent of significant events. Using spectral approaches, we propose a two-stage detection method: anomaly detection at a single-channel level, followed by the detection of cross-channel anomalies from the amalgamation of single channel anomalies. Our mathematical analysis shows that our method is likely to reduce the false alarm rate. We demonstrate our method in two applications: document understanding with multiple text corpora, and detection of repeated anomalies in video surveillance. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with related state-of-art methods, including the one-class SVM and principal component pursuit. In addition, our framework can be deployed in a decentralized manner, lending itself for large scale data stream analysis.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given a network of who-contacts-whom or who links-to-whom, will a contagious virus/product/meme spread and 'take-over' (cause an epidemic) or die-out quickly? What will change if nodes have partial, temporary or permanent immunity? The epidemic threshold is the minimum level of virulence to prevent a viral contagion from dying out quickly and determining it is a fundamental question in epidemiology and related areas. Most earlier work focuses either on special types of graphs or on specific epidemiological/cascade models. We are the first to show the G2-threshold (twice generalized) theorem, which nicely de-couples the effect of the topology and the virus model. Our result unifies and includes as special case older results and shows that the threshold depends on the first eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix, (a) for any graph and (b) for all propagation models in standard literature (more than 25, including H.I.V.) [20], [12]. Our discovery has broad implications for the vulnerability of real, complex networks, and numerous applications, including viral marketing, blog dynamics, influence propagation, easy answers to 'what-if' questions, and simplified design and evaluation of immunization policies. We also demonstrate our result using extensive simulations on one of the biggest available social contact graphs containing more than 31 million interactions among more than 1 million people representing the city of Portland, Oregon, USA.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given the pervasiveness of time series data in all human endeavors, and the ubiquity of clustering as a data mining application, it is somewhat surprising that the problem of time series clustering from a single stream remains largely unsolved. Most work on time series clustering considers the clustering of individual time series, e.g., gene expression profiles, individual heartbeats or individual gait cycles. The few attempts at clustering time series streams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases, and in other cases shown to work only on the most contrived datasets by carefully adjusting a large set of parameters. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions. First, we show that the problem definition for time series clustering from streams currently used is inherently flawed, and a new definition is necessary. Second, we show that the Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework offers an efficient, effective and essentially parameter-free method for time series clustering. We show that our method produces objectively correct results on a wide variety of datasets from medicine, zoology and industrial process analyses.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The increasing interest in archiving all of humankind's cultural artifacts has resulted in the digitization of millions of books, and soon a significant fraction of the world's books will be online. Most of the data in historical manuscripts is text, but there is also a significant fraction devoted to images. This fact has driven much of the recent increase in interest in query-by-content systems for images. While querying/indexing systems can undoubtedly be useful, we believe that the historical manuscript domain is finally ripe for true unsupervised discovery of patterns and regularities. To this end, we introduce an efficient and scalable system which can detect approximately repeated occurrences of shape patterns both within and between historical texts. We show that this ability to find repeated shapes allows automatic annotation of manuscripts, and allows users to trace the evolution of ideas. We demonstrate our ideas on datasets of scientific and cultural manuscripts dating back to the fourteenth century.</p>

We introduce Semstem, a new method for the reconstruction of so called stemmatic trees, i.e., trees encoding the copying relationships among a set of textual variants. Our method is based on a structural expectation-maximization (structural EM) algorithm. It is the first computer-based method able to estimate general latent tree structures, unlike earlier methods that are usually restricted to bifurcating trees where all the extant texts are placed in the leaf nodes. We present experiments on two well known benchmark data sets, showing that the new method outperforms current state-of-the-art both in terms of a numerical score as well as interpretability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Domain Adaptation (DA) methods are usually carried out by means of simply reducing the marginal distribution differences between the source and target domains, and subsequently using the resultant trained classifier, namely source classifier, for use in the target domain. However, in many cases, the true predictive distributions of the source and target domains can be vastly different especially when their class distributions are skewed, causing the issues of sample selection bias in DA. Hence, DA methods which leverage the source labeled data may suffer from poor generalization in the target domain, resulting in negative transfer. In addition, we observed that many DA methods use either a source classifier or a linear combination of source classifiers with a fixed weighting for predicting the target unlabeled data. Essentially, the labels of the target unlabeled data are spanned by the prediction of these source classifiers. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we propose to construct many source classifiers of diverse biases and learn the weight for each source classifier by directly minimizing the structural risk defined on the target unlabeled data so as to heal the possible sample selection bias. Since the weights are learned by maximizing the margin of separation between opposite classes on the target unlabeled data, the proposed method is established here as Maximal Margin Target Label Learning (MMTLL), which is in a form of Multiple Kernel Learning problem with many label kernels. Extensive experimental studies of MMTLL against several state-of-the-art methods on the Sentiment and Newsgroups datasets with various imbalanced class settings showed that MMTLL exhibited robust accuracies on all the settings considered and was resilient to negative transfer, in contrast to other counterpart methods which suffered significantly in prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Graph analysis is playing an increasingly important role in science and industry. Due to numerous limitations in sharing real-world graphs, models for generating massive graphs are critical for developing better algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the stochastic Kronecker graph model (SKG), which is the foundation of the Graph500 supercomputer benchmark due to its many favorable properties and easy parallelization. Our goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the parameters and properties of this model so that its functionality as a benchmark is increased. We develop a rigorous mathematical analysis that shows this model cannot generate a power-law distribution or even a lognormal distribution. However, we formalize an enhanced version of the SKG model that uses random noise for smoothing. We prove both in theory and in practice that this enhancement leads to a lognormal distribution. Additionally, we provide a precise analysis of isolated vertices, showing that graphs that are produced by SKG might be quite different than intended. For example, between 50% and 75% of the vertices in the Graph500 benchmarks will be isolated. Finally, we show that this model tends to produce extremely small core numbers (compared to most social networks and other real graphs) for common parameter choices.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In recent years, semi-supervised clustering (SSC) has aroused considerable interests from the machine learning and data mining communities. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised clustering approach with enhanced spectral embedding (ESE) which not only considers structure information contained in data sets but also makes use of prior side information such as pair wise constraints. Specially, we first construct a symmetry-favored k-NN graph which is highly robust to noisy objects and can reflect the underlying manifold structure of data. Then we learn the enhanced spectral embedding towards an ideal representation as consistent with the pair wise constraints as possible. Finally, through taking advantage of Laplacian regularization, we formulate learning spectral representation as semi definite-quadratic-linear programs (SQLPs) under the squared loss function or small semi definitive programs (SDPs) under the hinge loss function, which both can be efficiently solved. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art SSC algorithms on both vector-based and graph-based clustering.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
How to address the challenges of the "curse of dimensionality" in clustering? Clustering is a powerful data mining technique for structuring and organizing vast amounts of data. However, the high-dimensional data space is usually very sparse and meaningful clusters can only be found in lower dimensional subspaces. In many applications the subspaces hosting the clusters provide valuable information for interpreting the major patterns in the data. Detection of subspace clusters is challenging since usually many of the attributes are noisy, some attributes may exhibit correlations among each other and only few of the attributes truly contribute to the cluster structure. In this paper, we propose ORSC (Arbitrarily ORiented Synchronized Clusters), a novel effective and efficient method to subspace clustering inspired by synchronization. Synchronization is a basic phenomenon prevalent in nature, capable of controlling even highly complex processes such as opinion formation in a group. Control of complex processes is achieved by simple operations based on interactions between objects. Relying on the interaction model for synchronization, our approach ORSC (1) naturally detects correlation clusters in arbitrarily oriented subspaces, including (2) arbitrarily shaped non-linear correlation clusters. Our approach is (3) robust against noise points and outliers. In contrast to previous methods, ORSC is (4) easy to parameterize, since there is no need to specify the subspace dimensionality and all interesting subspace clusters can be detected. Finally, (5) ORSC outperforms most comparison methods in terms of runtime efficiency and is highly scalable to large and high-dimensional data sets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present Generalized Fast Subset Sums (GFSS), a new Bayesian framework for scalable and accurate detection of irregularly shaped spatial clusters using multiple data streams. GFSS extends the previously proposed Multivariate Bayesian Scan Statistic (MBSS) and Fast Subset Sums (FSS) approaches for detection of emerging events. The detection power of MBSS is primarily limited by computational considerations, which limit it to searching over circular spatial regions. GFSS enables more accurate and timely detection by defining a hierarchical prior over all subsets of the N locations, first selecting a local neighborhood consisting of a center location and its neighbors, and introducing a sparsity parameter p to describe how likely each location in the neighborhood is to be affected. This approach allows us to consider all possible subsets of locations (including irregularly-shaped regions) but also puts higher weight on more compact regions. We demonstrate that MBSS and FSS are both special cases of this general framework (assuming p = 1 and p = 0.5 respectively), but substantially higher detection power can be achieved by choosing an appropriate value of p. Thus we show that the distribution of the sparsity parameter p can be accurately learned from a small number of labeled events. Our evaluation results (on synthetic disease outbreaks injected into real-world hospital data) show that the GFSS method with learned sparsity parameter has higher detection power and spatial accuracy than MBSS and FSS, particularly when the affected region is irregular or elongated. We also show that the learned models can be used for event characterization, accurately distinguishing between two otherwise identical event types based on the sparsity of the affected spatial region.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we explore how to use ranking SVM to train the feature weights for query-focused multi-document summarization. To apply a supervised learning method to sentence extraction in multi-document summarization, we need to derive the sentence labels for training corpus from the existing human labeling data in form of. However, this process is not trivial, because the human summaries are abstractive, and do not necessarily well match the sentences in the documents. In this paper, we try to address the above problem from the following two aspects. First, we make use of sentence-to-sentence relationships to better estimate the probability of a sentence in the document set to be a summary sentence. Second, to make the derived training data less sensitive, we adopt a cost sensitive loss in the ranking SVM's objective function. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
With the outsourcing of small tasks becoming easier, it is possible to obtain non-expert/imperfect labels at low cost. With low-cost imperfect labeling, it is straightforward to collect multiple labels for the same data items. This paper addresses the strategies of utilizing these multiple labels for improving the performance of supervised learning, based on two basic ideas: majority voting and pair wise solutions. We show several interesting results based on our experiments. The soft majority voting strategies can reduce the bias and roughness, and improve the performance of the directed hard majority voting strategy. Pair wise strategies can completely avoid the bias by having both sides (potential correct and incorrect/noisy information) considered (for binary classification). They have very good performance whenever there are a few or many labels available. However, it could also keep the noise. The improved variation that reduces the impact of the noisy information is recommended. All five strategies investigated are labeling quality agnostic strategies, and can be applied to real world applications directly. The experimental results show some of them perform better than or at least very close to the gnostic strategies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many of tree kernels in the literature are designed tanking advantage of the mapping kernel framework. The most important advantage of using this framework is that we have a strong theorem to examine positive definiteness of the resulting tree kernels. In the mapping kernel framework, each data object is viewed as a collection of components, and a mapping kernel for a pair of data objects is determined as a sum of kernel values of component pairs over a certain range determined according to the purpose of use of the resulting mapping kernel. For those tree kernels known to belong to the mapping kernel category, the string kernel of the product type is commonly used to compute the kernel values of component pairs. This is because it is known that use of the product-type string kernel together with the mapping kernel framework allows us to have recursive formulas to calculate the resulting tree kernels efficiently. We significantly generalizes this result. In fact, we show that we can use partition able kernels, a new class of string kernels instead of the product-type string kernel to enjoy the same advantage, that is, efficient computation based on recursive formulas. The class of partition able kernels is abundant, and contains the product-type string kernels just as an instance. Also, this result, not limited to tree kernels, can be applied to general mapping kernels after we formalize the decomposition properties of trees as the new notion of pretty decomposability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Pattern discovery is at the core of numerous data mining tasks. Although many methods focus on efficiency in pattern mining, they still suffer from the problem of choosing a threshold that influences the final extraction result. The goal of our study is to make the results of pattern mining useful from a user-preference point of view. To this end, we integrate into the pattern discovery process the idea of skyline queries in order to mine skyline patterns in a threshold-free manner. Because the skyline patterns satisfy a formal property of dominations, they not only have a global interest but also have semantics that are easily understood by the user. In this work, we first establish theoretical relationships between pattern condensed representations and skyline pattern mining. We also show that it is possible to compute automatically a subset of measures involved in the user query which allows the patterns to be condensed and thus facilitates the computation of the skyline patterns. This forms the basis for a novel approach to mining skyline patterns. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach over several data sets including a use case from chemo informatics and show that small sets of dominant patterns are produced under various measures.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Mining web traffic data has been addressed in literature mostly using sequential pattern mining techniques. Recently, a more powerful pattern called partial order was introduced, with the hope of providing a more compact result set. A further approach towards this goal, valid for both sequential patterns and partial orders, consists in building a statistical significance test for frequent patterns. Our method is based on probabilistic generative models and provides a direct way to rank the extracted patterns. It leaves open the number of patterns of interest, which depends on the application, but provides an alternative criterion to frequency of occurrence: statistical significance. In this paper, we focus on the construction of an algorithm which calculates the probability of partial orders under a first-order Markov reference model, and we show how to use those probabilities to assess the statistical significance of a set of mined partial orders.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Mining patterns from multi-relational data is a problem attracting increasing interest within the data mining community. Traditional data mining approaches are typically developed for highly simplified types of data, such as an attribute-value table or a binary database, such that those methods are not directly applicable to multi-relational data. Nevertheless, multi-relational data is a more truthful and therefore often also a more powerful representation of reality. Mining patterns of a suitably expressive syntax directly from this representation, is thus a research problem of great importance. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to mining patterns in multi-relational data. We propose a new syntax for multi-relational patterns as complete connected sub graphs in a representation of the database as a k-partite graph. We show how this pattern syntax is generally applicable to multirelational data, while it reduces to well-known tiles [7] when the data is a simple binary or attribute-value table. We propose RMiner, an efficient algorithm to mine such patterns, and we introduce a method for quantifying their interestingness when contrasted with prior information of the data miner. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our approach by discussing results on real-world and synthetic databases.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many applications of data mining one knows beforehand that the response variable should be monotone (either increasing or decreasing) in the attributes. In ordinal classification, changing the class labels of a data set (relabeling) so that the data becomes monotone, is useful for at least two reasons. Firstly, models trained on relabeled data tend to have better predictive performance than models trained on the original data. Secondly, relabeling is an important building block for the construction of monotone classifiers. However, optimal monotone relabelings are rarely unique, and so far an efficient algorithm to generate them all has been lacking. The main result of this paper is an efficient algorithm to produce the structure of all optimal monotone relabelings. We also show that counting the solutions is #P-complete and give algorithms for efficiently enumerating all solutions, as well as sampling uniformly from the set of solutions. Experiments show that relabeling non-monotone data can improve the predictive performance of models trained on that data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Recursive strategy is the oldest and most intuitive strategy to forecast a time series multiple steps ahead. At the same time, it is well-known that this strategy suffers from the accumulation of errors as long as the forecasting horizon increases. We propose a variant of the Recursive strategy, called RECNOISY, which perturbs the initial dataset at each step of the forecasting process in order to i) handle more properly the estimated values at each forecasting step and ii) decrease the accumulation of errors induced by the Recursive strategy. In addition to the RECNOISY strategy, we propose another strategy, called HYBRID, which for each horizon selects the most accurate approach among the REC and the RECNOISY strategies according to the estimated accuracy. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we carry out an experimental session based on the 111 times series of the NN5 forecasting competition. Accuracy results are presented together with a paired comparison over the horizons and the time series. The preliminary results show that our proposed approaches are promising in terms of forecasting performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Mining frequent patterns is plagued by the problem of pattern explosion making pattern reduction techniques a key challenge in pattern mining. In this paper we propose a novel theoretical framework for pattern reduction. We do this by measuring the robustness of a property of an item set such as closed ness or non-derivability. The robustness of a property is the probability that this property holds on random subsets of the original data. We study four properties: closed, free, non-derivable and totally shattered item sets, demonstrating how we can compute the robustness analytically without actually sampling the data. Our concept of robustness has many advantages: Unlike statistical approaches for reducing patterns, we do not assume a null hypothesis or any noise model and the patterns reported are simply a subset of all patterns with this property as opposed to approximate patterns for which the property does not really hold. If the underlying property is monotonic, then the measure is also monotonic, allowing us to efficiently mine robust item sets. We further derive a parameter-free technique for ranking item sets that can be used for top-k approaches. Our experiments demonstrate that we can successfully use the robustness measure to reduce the number of patterns and that ranking yields interesting itemsets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Density estimation is the ubiquitous base modelling mechanism employed for many tasks such as clustering, classification, anomaly detection and information retrieval. Commonly used density estimation methods such as kernel density estimator and k-nearest neighbour density estimator have high time and space complexities which render them inapplicable in problems with large data size and even a moderate number of dimensions. This weakness sets the fundamental limit in existing algorithms for all these tasks. We propose the first density estimation method which stretches this fundamental limit to an extent that dealing with millions of data can now be done easily and quickly. We analyze the error of the new estimation (from the true density) using a bias-variance analysis. We then perform an empirical evaluation of the proposed method by replacing existing density estimators with the new one in two current density-based algorithms, namely, DBSCAN and LOF. The results show that the new density estimation method significantly improves the runtime of DBSCAN and LOF, while maintaining or improving their task-specific performances in clustering and anomaly detection, respectively. The new method empowers these algorithms, currently limited to small data size only, to process very large databases - setting a new benchmark for what density-based algorithms can achieve.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases. A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive item sets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the item set space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and delicious, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we consider the problem of conditional anomaly detection that aims to identify data instances with an unusual response or a class label. We develop a new non-parametric approach for conditional anomaly detection based on the soft harmonic solution, with which we estimate the confidence of the label to detect anomalous mislabeling. We further regularize the solution to avoid the detection of isolated examples and examples on the boundary of the distribution support. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on several synthetic and UCI ML datasets in detecting unusual labels when compared to several baseline approaches. We also evaluate the performance of our method on a real-world electronic health record dataset where we seek to identify unusual patient-management decisions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a simple yet effective strategy to induce a task dependent feature representation using ensembles of random decision trees. The new feature mapping is efficient in space and time, and provides a metric transformation that is non parametric and not implicit in nature (i.e. not expressed via a kernel matrix), nor limited to the transductive setup. The main advantage of the proposed mapping lies in its flexibility to adapt to several types of learning tasks ranging from regression to multi-label classification, and to deal in a natural way with missing values. Finally, we provide an extensive empirical study of the properties of the learned feature representation over real and artificial datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Class imbalance (i.e., scenarios in which classes are unequally represented in the training data) occurs in many real-world learning tasks. Yet despite its practical importance, there is no established theory of class imbalance, and existing methods for handling it are therefore not well motivated. In this work, we approach the problem of imbalance from a probabilistic perspective, and from this vantage identify dataset characteristics (such as dimensionality, sparsity, etc.) that exacerbate the problem. Motivated by this theory, we advocate the approach of bagging an ensemble of classifiers induced over balanced bootstrap training samples, arguing that this strategy will often succeed where others fail. Thus in addition to providing a theoretical understanding of class imbalance, corroborated by our experiments on both simulated and real datasets, we provide practical guidance for the data mining practitioner working with imbalanced data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Once an image is decomposed into a number of visual primitives, e.g., local interest points or salient image regions, it is of great interests to discover meaningful visual patterns from them. Conventional clustering (e.g., k-means) of visual primitives, however, usually ignores the spatial dependency among them, thus cannot discover the high-level visual patterns of complex spatial structure. To overcome this problem, we propose to consider both spatial and feature contexts among visual primitives for pattern discovery. By discovering both spatial co-occurrence patterns among visual primitives and feature co-occurrence patterns among different types of features, our method can better handle the ambiguities of visual primitives, by leveraging these co-occurrences. We formulate the problem as a regularized k-means clustering, and propose an iterative bottom-up/top-down self-learning procedure to gradually refine the result until it converges. The experiments of image text on discovery and image region clustering convince that combining spatial and feature contexts can significantly improve the pattern discovery results.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The fast growth of Internet and modern technologies has brought data involving objects of multiple types that are related to each other, called as Multi-Type Relational data. Traditional clustering methods for single-type data rarely work well on them, which calls for new clustering techniques, called as high-order co-clustering (HOCC), to deal with the multiple types of data at the same time. A major challenge in developing HOCC methods is how to effectively make use of all available information contained in a multi-type relational data set, including both inter-type and intra-type relationships. Meanwhile, because many real world data sets are often of large sizes, clustering methods with computationally efficient solution algorithms are of great practical interest. In this paper, we first present a general HOCC framework, named as Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Tri-factorization (O-NMTF), for simultaneous clustering of multi-type relational data. The proposed O-NMTF approach employs Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) to simultaneously cluster different types of data using the inter-type relationships, and incorporate intra-type information through manifold regularization, where, different from existing works, we emphasize the importance of the orthogonal ties of the factor matrices of NMTF. Based on O-NMTF, we further develop a novel Fast Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization (F-NMTF) approach to deal with large-scale data. Instead of constraining the factor matrices of NMTF to be nonnegative as in existing methods, F-NMTF constrains them to be cluster indicator matrices, a special type of nonnegative matrices. As a result, the optimization problem of the proposed method can be decoupled, which results in sub problems of much smaller sizes requiring much less matrix multiplications, such that our new algorithm scales well to real world data of large sizes. Extensive experimental evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of our new approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many social networks, there exist two types of users that exhibit different influence and different behavior. For instance, statistics have shown that less than 1% of the Twitter users (e.g. entertainers, politicians, writers) produce 50% of its content, while the others (e.g. fans, followers, readers) have much less influence and completely different social behavior. In this paper, we define and explore a novel problem called community kernel detection in order to uncover the hidden community structure in large social networks. We discover that influential users pay closer attention to those who are more similar to them, which leads to a natural partition into different community kernels. We propose Greedy and We BA, two efficient algorithms for finding community kernels in large social networks. Greedy is based on maximum cardinality search, while We BA formalizes the problem in an optimization framework. We conduct experiments on three large social networks: Twitter, Wikipedia, and Coauthor, which show that We BA achieves an average 15%-50% performance improvement over the other state-of-the-art algorithms, and We BA is on average 6-2,000 times faster in detecting community kernels.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Name ambiguity has long been viewed as a challenging problem in many applications, such as scientific literature management, people search, and social network analysis. When we search a person name in these systems, many documents (e.g., papers, web pages) containing that person's name may be returned. It is hard to determine which documents are about the person we care about. Although much research has been conducted, the problem remains largely unsolved, especially with the rapid growth of the people information available on the Web. In this paper, we try to study this problem from a new perspective and propose an ADANA method for disambiguating person names via active user interactions. In ADANA, we first introduce a pairwise factor graph (PFG) model for person name disambiguation. The model is flexible and can be easily extended by incorporating various features. Based on the PFG model, we propose an active name disambiguation algorithm, aiming to improve the disambiguation performance by maximizing the utility of the user's correction. Experimental results on three different genres of data sets show that with only a few user corrections, the error rate of name disambiguation can be reduced to 3.1%. A real system has been developed based on the proposed method and is available online.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Vector Space Model (VSM) is widely used to represent documents and web pages. It is simple and easy to deal computationally, but it also oversimplifies a document into a vector, susceptible to noise, and cannot explicitly represent underlying topics of a document. A matrix representation of document is proposed in this paper: rows represent distinct terms and columns represent cohesive segments. The matrix model views a document as a set of segments, and each segment is a probability distribution over a limited number of latent topics which can be mapped to clustering structures. The latent topic extraction based on the matrix representation of documents is formulated as a constraint optimization problem in which each matrix (i.e., a document) A<sub>i</sub> is factorized into a common base determined by non-negative matrices L and R<sup>T</sup>, and a non-negative weight matrix M<sub>i</sub> such that the sum of reconstruction error on all documents is minimized. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that it is feasible to use the matrix model for document clustering: (1) compared with vector representation, using matrix representation improves clustering quality consistently, and the proposed approach achieves a relative accuracy improvement up to 66% on the studied datasets, and (2) the proposed method outperforms baseline methods such as k-means and NMF, and complements the state-of-the-art methods like LDA and PLSI. Furthermore, the proposed matrix model allows more refined information retrieval at a segment level instead of at a document level, which enables the return of more relevant documents in information retrieval tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many applications naturally involve time series data, and the vector auto regression (VAR) and the structural VAR (SVAR) are dominant tools to investigate relations between variables in time series. In the first part of this work, we show that the SVAR method is incapable of identifying contemporaneous causal relations when data follow Gaussian distributions. In addition, least squares estimators become unreliable when the scales of the problems are large and observations are limited. In the remaining part, we propose an approach to apply Bayesian network learning algorithms to identify SVARs from time series data in order to capture both temporal and contemporaneous causal relations and avoid high-order statistical tests. The difficulty of applying Bayesian network learning algorithms to time series is that the sizes of the networks corresponding to time series tend to be large and high-order statistical tests are required by Bayesian network learning algorithms in this case. To overcome the difficulty, we show that the search space of conditioning sets d-separating two vertices should be subsets of Markov blankets. Based on this fact, we propose an algorithm learning Bayesian networks locally and making the largest order of statistical tests independent of the scales of the problems. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Mining high utility item sets from transactional databases is an important data mining task, which refers to the discovery of item sets with high utilities (e.g. high profits). Although several studies have been carried out, current methods may present too many high utility item sets for users, which degrades the performance of the mining task in terms of execution and memory efficiency. To achieve high efficiency for the mining task and provide a concise mining result to users, we propose a novel framework in this paper for mining closed+ high utility item sets, which serves as a compact and loss less representation of high utility item sets. We present an efficient algorithm called CHUD (Closed+ High Utility item set Discovery) for mining closed+ high utility item sets. Further, a method called DAHU (Derive All High Utility item sets) is proposed to recover all high utility item sets from the set of closed+ high utility item sets without accessing the original database. Results of experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that CHUD and DAHU are very efficient with a massive reduction (up to 800 times in our experiments) in the number of high utility item sets. In addition, when all high utility item sets are recovered by DAHU, the approach combining CHUD and DAHU also outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in mining high utility item sets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent empirical evaluation has shown that the performance of collective classification models can vary based on the amount of class label information available for use during inference. In this paper, we further demonstrate that the relative performance of statistical relational models learned with different estimation methods changes as the availability of test set labels increases. We reason about the cause of this phenomenon from an information-theoretic perspective and this points to a previously unidentified consideration in the development of relational learning algorithms. In particular, we characterize the high propagation error of collective inference models that are estimated with maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE), and show how this affects performance across the spectrum of label availability when compared to MLE, which has low propagation error. Our formal study leads to a quantitative characterization that can be used to predict the confidence of local propagation for MPLE models. We use this to propose a mixture model that can learn the best trade-off between high and low propagation models. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world data show that our proposed method achieves comparable, or superior, results to both MPLE and low propagation models across the full spectrum of label availability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Matrix factorization methods are extremely useful in many data mining tasks, yet their performances are often degraded by outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel robust matrix factorization algorithm that is insensitive to outliers. We directly formulate robust factorization as a matrix approximation problem with constraints on the rank of the matrix and the cardinality of the outlier set. Then, unlike existing methods that resort to convex relaxations, we solve this problem directly and efficiently. In addition, structural knowledge about the outliers can be incorporated to find outliers more effectively. We applied this method in anomaly detection tasks on various data sets. Empirical results show that this new algorithm is effective in robust modeling and anomaly detection, and our direct solution achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods based on the L1-norm and the nuclear norm of matrices.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Clustering categorical sequences remains an open and challenging task due to the lack of an inherently meaningful measure of pair wise similarity between sequences. Model initialization is an unsolved problem in model-based clustering algorithms for categorical sequences. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective Markov model to approximate the conditional probability distribution (CPD) model, and use it to design a novel two-tier Markov model to represent a sequence cluster. Furthermore, we design a novel divisive hierarchical algorithm for clustering categorical sequences based on the two-tier Markov model. The experimental results on the data sets from three different domains demonstrate the promising performance of our models and clustering algorithm.</p>

Multi-type objects with multi-type relations are ubiquitous in real-world networks, e.g. bibliographic networks. Such networks are also called heterogeneous information networks. However, the research on clustering for heterogeneous information networks is little. A new algorithm, called NetClus, has been proposed in recent two years. Although NetClus is applied on a heterogeneous information network with a star network schema, considering the relations between center objects and all attribute objects linking to them, it ignores the relations between center objects such as citation relations, which also contain rich information. Hence, we think the star network schema cannot be used to characterize all possible relations without integrating the linkage structure among center objects, which we call the Center Linkage Structure, and there has been no practical way good enough to solve it. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, BibClus, for clustering heterogeneous objects with center linkage structure by taking a bibliographic information network as an example. In BibClus, we build a probabilistic model of pair wise hidden Markov random field (P-HMRF) to characterize the center linkage structure, and convert it to a factor graph. We further combine EM algorithm with factor graph theory, and design an efficient way based on message passing algorithm to inference marginal probabilities and estimate parameters at each iteration of EM. We also study how factor functions affect clustering performance with different function forms and constraints. For evaluating our proposed method, we have conducted thorough experiments on a real dataset that we had crawled from ACM Digital Library. The experimental results show that BibClus is effective and has a much higher quantity than the recently proposed algorithm, NetClus, in both recall and precision.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-instance learning, like other machine learning and data mining tasks, requires distance metrics. Although metric learning methods have been studied for many years, metric learners for multi-instance learning remain almost untouched. In this paper, we propose a framework called Multi-Instance MEtric Learning (MIMEL) to learn an appropriate distance under the multi-instance setting. The distance metric between two bags is defined using the Mahalanobis distance function. The problem is formulated by minimizing the KL divergence between two multivariate Gaussians under the constraints of maximizing the between-class bag distance and minimizing the within-class bag distance. To exploit the mechanism of how instances determine bag labels in multi-instance learning, we design a nonparametric density-estimation-based weighting scheme to assign higher "weights" to the instances that are more likely to be positive in positive bags. The weighting scheme itself has a small workload, which adds little extra computing costs to the proposed framework. Moreover, to further boost the classification accuracy, a kernel version of MIMEL is presented. We evaluate MIMEL, using not only several typical multi-instance tasks, but also two activity recognition datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MIMEL achieves better classification accuracy than many state-of-the-art distance based algorithms or kernel methods for multi-instance learning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-task and relational learning with Gaussian processes are two active but also orthogonal areas of research. So far, there has been few attempt at exploring relational information within multi-task Gaussian processes. While existing relational Gaussian process methods have focused on relations among entities and in turn could be employed within an individual task, we develop a class of Gaussian process models which incorporates relational information across multiple tasks. As we will show, inference and learning within the resulting class of models, called relational multi-task Gaussian processes, can be realized via a variational EM algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the usefulness of this approach: The observed relational knowledge at the level of tasks can indeed reveal additional pair wise correlations between tasks of interest and, in turn, improve prediction performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many clustering methods have been proposed for analyzing the relations inside networks with complex structures. Some of them can detect a mixture of assortative and disassortative structures in networks. All these methods are based on the fact that the entire network is observable. However, in the real world, the entities in networks, for example a social network, may be private, and thus, cannot be observed. We focus on private peer-to-peer networks in which all vertices are independent and private, and each vertex only knows about itself and its neighbors. We propose a privacy-preserving Gibbs sampling for clustering these types of private networks and detecting their mixed structures without revealing any private information about any individual entity. Moreover, the running cost of our method is related only to the number of clusters and the maximum degree, but is nearly independent of the number of vertices in the entire network.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper studies the problem of latent periodic topic analysis from time stamped documents. The examples of time stamped documents include news articles, sales records, financial reports, TV programs, and more recently, posts from social media websites such as Flickr, Twitter, and Face book. Different from detecting periodic patterns in traditional time series database, we discover the topics of coherent semantics and periodic characteristics where a topic is represented by a distribution of words. We propose a model called LPTA (Latent Periodic Topic Analysis) that exploits the periodicity of the terms as well as term co-occurrences. To show the effectiveness of our model, we collect several representative datasets including Seminar, DBLP and Flickr. The results show that our model can discover the latent periodic topics effectively and leverage the information from both text and time well.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Associative classifiers have received considerable attention due to their easy to understand models and promising performance. However, with a high dimensional dataset, associative classifiers inevitably face two challenges: (1) how to extract a minimal set of strong predictive rules from an explosive number of generated association rules, and (2) how to deal with the highly sensitive choice of the minimal support threshold. In order to address these two challenges, we introduce causality into associative classification, and propose a new framework of causal associative classification. In this framework, we use causal Bayesian networks to bridge irrelevant and redundant features with irrelevant and redundant rules in associative classification. Without loss of prediction power, the feature space involved with the antecedent of a classification rule is reduced to the space of the direct causes, direct effects, and direct causes of the direct effects, a.k.a. the Markov blanket, of the consequent of the rule in causal Bayesian networks. The proposed framework is instantiated via baseline classifiers using emerging patterns. Experimental results show that our framework significantly reduces the model complexity while outperforming the other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Data sparsity is a big challenge for collaborative filtering. This problem becomes more serious if the dataset is newly created and has even fewer ratings. By sharing knowledge among different datasets, multi-task learning is a promising technique to address this issue. Most prior work methods directly share objects (users or items) across different datasets. However, object identities and correspondences may not be known in many cases. We extend the previous work of Bayesian matrix factorization with Dirichlet process mixture into a multi-task learning approach by sharing latent parameters among different tasks. Our method does not require object identities and thus is more widely applicable. The proposed model is fully non-parametric in that the dimension of latent feature vectors is automatically determined. Inference is performed using the variational Bayesian algorithm, which is much faster than Gibbs sampling used by most other related Bayesian methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Lazy learning, such as k-nearest neighbor learning, has been widely applied to many applications. Known for well capturing data locality, lazy learning can be advantageous for highly dynamic and complex learning environments such as data streams. Yet its high memory consumption and low prediction efficiency have made it less favorable for stream oriented applications. Specifically, traditional lazy learning stores all the training data and the inductive process is deferred until a query appears, whereas in stream applications, data records flow continuously in large volumes and the prediction of class labels needs to be made in a timely manner. In this paper, we provide a systematic solution that overcomes the memory and efficiency limitations and enables fast lazy learning for concept drifting data streams. In particular, we propose a novel Lazy-tree (Ltree for short) indexing structure that dynamically maintains compact high-level summaries of historical stream records. L-trees are M-Tree [5] like, height-balanced, and can help achieve great memory consumption reduction and sub-linear time complexity for prediction. Moreover, L-trees continuously absorb new stream records and discard outdated ones, so they can naturally adapt to the dynamically changing concepts in data streams for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
To alleviate the memory and computational burdens of spectral clustering for large scale problems, some kind of low-rank matrix approximation is usually employed. Nystro&#x0308;m method is an efficient technique to generate low rank matrix approximation and its most important aspect is sampling. The matrix approximation errors of several sampling schemes have been theoretically analyzed for a number of learning tasks. However, the impact of matrix approximation error on the clustering performance of spectral clustering has not been studied. In this paper, we firstly analyze the performance of Nystro&#x0308;m method in terms of cluster ability, thus answer the impact of matrix approximation error on the clustering performance of spectral clustering. Our analysis immediately suggests an incremental sampling scheme for the Nystro&#x0308;m method based spectral clustering. Experimental results show that the proposed incremental sampling scheme outperforms existing sampling schemes on various clustering tasks and image segmentation applications, and its efficiency is comparable with existing sampling schemes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust algorithm for graph-based transductive classification. After approximating a graph with a spanning tree, we develop a linear-time algorithm to label the tree such that the cut size of the tree is minimized. This significantly improves typical graph-based methods, which either have a cubic time complexity (for a dense graph) or O(kn<sup>2</sup>) (for a sparse graph with k denoting the node degree). Furthermore, our method shows great robustness to the graph construction both theoretically and empirically; this overcomes another big problem of traditional graph-based methods. In addition to its good scalability and robustness, the proposed algorithm demonstrates high accuracy. In particular, on a graph with 400,000 nodes (in which 10,000 nodes are labeled) and 10,455,545 edges, our algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 99.6% but takes less than 10 seconds to label all the unlabeled data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The problem of graph classification has drawn much attention in the last decade. Conventional approaches on graph classification focus on mining discriminative sub graph features under supervised settings. The feature selection strategies strictly follow the assumption that both positive and negative graphs exist. However, in many real-world applications, the negative graph examples are not available. In this paper we study the problem of how to select useful sub graph features and perform graph classification based upon only positive and unlabeled graphs. This problem is challenging and different from previous works on PU learning, because there are no predefined features in graph data. Moreover, the sub graph enumeration problem is NP-hard. We need to identify a subset of unlabeled graphs that are most likely to be negative graphs. However, the negative graph selection problem and the sub graph feature selection problem are correlated. Before the reliable negative graphs can be resolved, we need to have a set of useful sub graph features. In order to address this problem, we first derive an evaluation criterion to estimate the dependency between sub graph features and class labels based on a set of estimated negative graphs. In order to build accurate models for the PU learning problem on graph data, we propose an integrated approach to concurrently select the discriminative features and the negative graphs in an iterative manner. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Diagnostic genes refer to the genes closely related to a specific disease phenotype, the powers of which to distinguish between different classes are often high. Most methods to discovering the powerful diagnostic genes are either singleton discriminability-based or combination discriminability-based. However, both ignore the abundant interactions among genes, which widely exist in the real world. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a new point of view and make the following contributions: (1) we propose an EWave model, which profitably exploits the ordered expressions among genes based on the defined equivalent dimension group sequences taking into account the "noise" universal in the real data, (2) we devise a novel sequence rule, namely interesting non-redundant contrast sequence rule, which is able to capture the difference between different phenotypes in a high accuracy using as few as possible genes, (3) we present an efficient algorithm called NRMINER to find such rules. Unlike the conventional column enumeration and the more recent row enumeration, it performs a novel template-driven enumeration by making use of the special characteristic of micro array data modeled by EWave. Extensive experiments conducted on various synthetic and real datasets show that: (1) NRMINER is significantly faster than the competing algorithm by up to about one order of magnitude, (2) it provides a higher accuracy using fewer genes. Many diagnostic genes discovered by NRMINER are proved biologically related to some disease.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Semi-supervised clustering (i.e., clustering with knowledge-based constraints) has emerged as an important variant of the traditional clustering paradigms. However, most existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms are designed for partitional clustering methods and few research efforts have been reported on semi-supervised hierarchical clustering methods. In addition, current semi-supervised clustering methods have been focused on the use of background information in the form of instance level must-link and cannot-link constraints, which are not suitable for hierarchical clustering where data objects are linked over different hierarchy levels. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering framework based on ultra-metric dendrogram distance. The proposed framework is able to incorporate triple-wise relative constraints. We establish the connection between hierarchical clustering and ultra-metric transformation of dissimilarity matrix and propose two techniques (the constrained optimization technique and the transitive dissimilarity based technique) for semi-supervised hierarchical clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Historical data used for supervised learning may contain discrimination. We study how to train classifiers on such data, so that they are discrimination free with respect to a given sensitive attribute, e.g., gender. Existing techniques that deal with this problem aim at removing all discrimination and do not take into account that part of the discrimination may be explainable by other attributes, such as, e.g., education level. In this context, we introduce and analyze the issue of conditional non-discrimination in classifier design. We show that some of the differences in decisions across the sensitive groups can be explainable and hence tolerable. We observe that in such cases, the existing discrimination aware techniques will introduce a reverse discrimination, which is undesirable as well. Therefore, we develop local techniques for handling conditional discrimination when one of the attributes is considered to be explanatory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new local techniques remove exactly the bad discrimination, allowing differences in decisions as long as they are explainable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we examine the problem of node re-identification from anonymized graphs. Typical graphs encountered in real applications are massive and sparse. In this paper, we will show that massive and sparse graphs have certain theoretical properties which make them susceptible to re-identification attacks. We design a systematic way to exploit these theoretical properties in order to construct re- identification signatures, which are also known as characteristic vectors. These signatures have the property that they are extremely robust to perturbations, especially for massive and sparse graphs. Our results show that even low levels of anonymization require perturbation levels which are significant enough to result in a massive loss of utility. Our experimental results also show that the true anonymization level of graphs is much lower than is implied by measures such as k-anonymity. Thus, the results of this paper establish that the problem of massive graph anonymization has fundamental theoretical barriers which prevent a fully effective solution.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents a novel structure preserving over sampling (SPO) technique for classifying imbalanced time series data. SPO generates synthetic minority samples based on multivariate Gaussian distribution by estimating the covariance structure of the minority class and regularizing the unreliable eigen spectrum. By preserving the main covariance structure and intelligently creating protective variances in the trivial eigen feature dimensions, the synthetic samples expand effectively into the void area in the data space without being too closely tied with existing minority-class samples. Extensive experiments based on several public time series datasets demonstrate that our proposed SPO in conjunction with support vector machines can achieve better performances than existing over sampling methods and state-of-the-art methods in time series classification.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose an algorithm that, given a high-dimensional dataset with missing values, achieves the distinct goals of learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the data (the dimensionality reduction problem) and reconstructing the missing high-dimensional data (the matrix completion, or imputation, problem). The algorithm follows the Dimensionality Reduction by Unsupervised Regression approach, where one alternately optimizes over the latent coordinates given the reconstruction and projection mappings, and vice versa, but here we also optimize over the missing data, using an efficient, globally convergent Gauss-Newton scheme. We also show how to project or reconstruct test data with missing values. We achieve impressive reconstructions while learning good latent representations in image restoration with 50% missing pixels.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The training time of most learning algorithms increases as the size of training data increases. Yet, recent advances in linear binary SVM and LR challenge this commonsense by proposing an inverse dependency property, where the training time decreases as the size of training data increases. In this paper, we study the inverse dependency property of multi-class classification problem. We describe a general framework for multi-class classification problem with a single objective to achieve inverse dependency and extend it to three popular multi-class algorithms. We present theoretical results demonstrating its convergence and inverse dependency guarantee. We conduct experiments to empirically verify the inverse dependency of all the three algorithms on large-scale datasets as well as to ensure the accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Topic-focused multi-document summarization aims to produce a summary given a specific topic description and a set of related documents. It has become a crucial text processing task in many real applications that can help users consume the massive information. This paper presents a novel extractive approach based on supervised lazy random walk (Super Lazy). This approach naturally combines the rich features of sentences with the intrinsic sentence graph structure in a principled way, and thus enjoys the advantages of both the existing supervised and unsupervised approaches. Moreover, our approach can achieve the three major goals of topic-focused multi-document summarization (i.e. relevance, salience and diversity) simultaneously with a unified ranking process. Experiments on the benchmark dataset TAC2008 and TAC2009 are performed and the ROUGE evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform both the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In recent years, an increasing number of security threats have brought a serious risk to the internet and computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in detecting various kinds of attacks. Developing adaptive and flexible oriented IDSs remains a challenging and demanding task due to the incessantly appearance of new types of attacks and sabotaging approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised statistical approach for detecting network based attacks. In our approach, patterns of normal and intrusive activities are learned through finite generalized Dirichlet mixture models, in the context of Bayesian variational inference. Under the proposed variational framework, the parameters, the complexity of the mixture model, and the features saliency can be estimated simultaneously, in a closed-form. We evaluate the proposed approach using the popular KDD CUP 1999 data set. Experimental results show that this approach is able to detect many different types of intrusions accurately with a low false positive rate.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Identifying differentially expressed genes is an important problem in gene expression analysis, since these genes, exhibiting sufficiently different expression levels under distinct experiment conditions, could be critical for tracing the progression of a disease. In a micro array study, genes are usually sorted in terms of their differentiation abilities with the more differentially expressed genes being ranked higher in the list. As more micro array studies are conducted, rank aggregation becomes an important means to combine such ranked gene lists in order to discover more reliable differentially expressed genes. In this paper, we study a novel weighted gene rank aggregation problem whose complexity is at least NP-hard. To tackle the problem, we develop a new Markov-chain based rank aggregation method called Weighted MC (WMC). The WMC algorithm makes use of rank-based weight information to generate the transition matrix. Extensive experiments on the real biological datasets show that our approach is more efficient in aggregating long gene lists. Importantly, the WMC method is much more robust for identifying biologically significant genes compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As a typical data mining research topic, sequential pattern mining has been studied extensively for the past decade. Recently, mining various sequential patterns incrementally over stream data has raised great interest. Due to the challenges of mining stream data, many difficulties not so obvious in static data mining have to be reconsidered carefully. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which stores only frequent closed prefixes in its enumeration tree structure, used for mining and maintaining patterns in the current sliding window, to solve the frequent closed sequential pattern mining problem efficiently over stream data. Some effective search space pruning and pattern closure checking strategies have been also devised to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithm significantly in both running time and memory use.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose to conduct anomaly detection across multiple sources to identify objects that have inconsistent behavior across these sources. We assume that a set of objects can be described from various perspectives (multiple information sources). The underlying clustering structure of normal objects is usually shared by multiple sources. However, anomalous objects belong to different clusters when considering different aspects. For example, there exist movies that are expected to be liked by kids by genre, but are liked by grown-ups based on user viewing history. To identify such objects, we propose to compute the distance between different eigen decomposition results of the same object with respect to different sources as its anomalous score. We also give interpretations from the perspectives of constrained spectral clustering and random walks over graph. Experimental results on several UCI as well as DBLP and Movie Lens datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Much research has been devoted to topic detection from text, but one major challenge has not been addressed: revealing the rich relationships that exist among the detected topics. Finding such relationships is important since many applications are interested in how topics come into being, how they develop, grow, disintegrate, and finally disappear. In this paper, we present a novel method that reveals the connections between topics discovered from the text data. Specifically, our method focuses on how one topic splits into multiple topics, and how multiple topics merge into one topic. We adopt the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model, and propose an incremental Gibbs sampling algorithm to incrementally derive and refine the labels of clusters. We then characterize the splitting and merging patterns among clusters based on how labels change. We propose a global analysis process that focuses on cluster splitting and merging, and a finer granularity analysis process that helps users to better understand the content of the clusters and the evolution patterns. We also develop a visualization process to present the results.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A critical open problem in emph{ab initio} protein folding is protein energy function design, which pertains to defining the energy of protein conformations in a way that makes folding most efficient and reliable. In this paper, we address this issue as a weight optimization problem and utilize a machine learning approach, learning-to-rank, to solve this problem. We investigate the ranking-via-classification approach, especially the Ranking SVM method and compare it with the state-of-the-art approach to the problem using the MINUIT optimization package. To maintain the physicality of the results, we impose non-negativity constraints on the weights. For this we develop two efficient non-negative support vector machine (NNSVM) methods, derived from L2-norm SVM and L1-norm SVMs, respectively. We demonstrate an energy function which maintains the correct ordering with respect to structure dissimilarity to the native state more often, is more efficient and reliable for learning on large protein sets, and is qualitatively superior to the current state-of-the-art energy function.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent years have witnessed a great deal of attention in tracking news memes over the web, modeling shifts in the ebb and flow of their popularity. One of the most important features of news memes is that they seldom occur repeatedly, instead, they tend to shift to different but similar memes. In this work, we consider patterns in research memes, which differ significantly from news memes and have received very little attention. One significant difference between research memes and news memes lies in that research memes have cyclic development, motivating the need for models of cycles of research memes. Furthermore, these cycles may reveal important patterns of evolving research, shedding lights on how research progresses. In this paper, we formulate the modeling of the cycles of research memes, and propose solutions to the problem of identifying cycles and discovering patterns among these cycles. Experiments on two different domain applications indicate that our model does find meaningful patterns and our algorithms for pattern discovery are efficient for large scale data analysis.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Gaussian process classifiers (GPCs) have recently attracted more and more attention from the machine learning community. However, because the posterior needs to be approximated by using a tractable Gaussian distribution, they usually suffer from high computational cost which is prohibitive for practical applications. In this paper, we present a new Gaussian process model termed as twin Gaussian processes for binary classification. The basic idea is to make predictions based on two latent functions with Gaussian process prior, each of which is close to one of the two classes and is as far as possible from the other. Being compared with the published GPCs, the proposed algorithm allows for an explicit inference based on analytical methods, thereby avoiding the high computational cost caused by approximating the posterior with Gaussian distribution. Experimental results on several benchmark data sets show that the proposed algorithm is valid and can achieve superior performance to the published algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most algorithms for mining or indexing time series data do not operate directly on the original data, but instead they consider alternative representations that include transforms, quantization, approximation, and multi-resolution abstractions. Choosing the best representation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical step in time series data mining. In this paper, we investigate techniques to discover the natural intrinsic representation model, dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. The ability to discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting the best parameters for particular algorithms, as characterizing data in such a manner is useful in its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification, clustering and outlier discovery. We will frame the discovery of these intrinsic features in the Minimal Description Length (MDL) framework. Extensive empirical tests show that our method is simpler, more general and significantly more accurate than previous methods, and has the important advantage of being essentially parameter-free.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most existing methods for clustering temporal data are based on either a strict similarity metric or a precisely defined temporal profile such as a sine, exponential wave etc. Also, these methods compute similarity metric across the entire time-span of the objects. However these types of temporal patterns are more useful in many biological analysis, where it is important to observe gene expression pattens across arbitrary subintervals. These types of temporal patterns are very useful in bioinformatics, where it is important to observe gene expression pattens across arbitrary subintervals. In this paper we present an algorithm for searching for multiple contiguous temporal subintervals within which the selected objects demonstrate existence of clear patterns. We demonstrate the power and advantages of our algorithm by using a synthetic dataset and a pharmacokinetics dataset for which other researchers have recently published their results. We compare and contrast our results with these results to show superiority of our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Order-preserving sub matrices are an important tool for the analysis of gene expression data. As finding large order-preserving sub matrices is a computationally hard problem, previous work has investigated both exact but exponential-time as well as polynomial-time but inexact algorithms for finding large order-preserving sub matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel exact algorithm to find maximum order preserving sub matrices which is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the number of columns of the provided gene expression data. In particular, our algorithm is based on solving a sequence of mixed integer linear programs and it exhibits better guarantees as well as better runtime performance as compared to the state-of-the-art exact algorithms. Our empirical study in benchmark datasets shows large improvement in terms of computational speed.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The promise of cloud computing is to provide computing resources instantly whenever they are needed. The state-of-art virtual machine (VM) provisioning technology can provision a VM in tens of minutes. This latency is unacceptable for jobs that need to scale out during computation. To truly enable on-the-fly scaling, new VM needs to be ready in seconds upon request. In this paper, We present an online temporal data mining system called ASAP, to model and predict the cloud VM demands. ASAP aims to extract high level characteristics from VM provisioning request stream and notify the provisioning system to prepare VMs in advance. For quantification issue, we propose Cloud Prediction Cost to encodes the cost and constraints of the cloud and guide the training of prediction algorithms. Moreover, we utilize a two-level ensemble method to capture the characteristics of the high transient demands time series. Experimental results using historical data from an IBM cloud in operation demonstrate that ASAP significantly improves the cloud service quality and provides possibility for on-the-fly provisioning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper addresses the task of set-expansion on free text. Set-expansion has been viewed as a problem of generating an extensive list of instances of a concept of interest, given a few examples of the concept as input. Our key contribution is that we show that the concept definition can be significantly improved by specifying some negative examples in the input, along with the positive examples. The state-of-the art centroid-based approach to set-expansion doesn't readily admit the negative examples. We develop an inference-based approach to set-expansion which naturally allows for negative examples and show that it performs significantly better than a strong baseline.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Complex systems have been widely studied to characterize their structural behaviors from a topological perspective. High modularity is one of the recurrent features of real-world complex systems. Various graph clustering algorithms have been applied to identifying communities in social networks or modules in biological networks. However, their applicability to real-world systems has been limited because of the massive scale and complex connectivity of the networks. In this study, we exploit a novel information-theoretic model for graph clustering. The entropy-based clustering approach finds locally optimal clusters by growing a random seed in a manner that minimizes graph entropy. We design and analyze modifications that further improve its performance. Assigning priority in seed-selection and seed-growth is well applicable to the scale-free networks characterized by the hub-oriented structure. Computing seed-growth in parallel streams also decomposes an extremely large network efficiently. The experimental results with real biological and social networks show that the entropy-based approach has better performance than competing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Hashing refers to methods for embedding high dimensional data into a similarity-preserving low-dimensional Hamming space such that similar objects are indexed by binary codes whose Hamming distances are small. Learning hash functions from data has recently been recognized as a promising approach to approximate nearest neighbor search for high dimensional data. Most of 'learning to hash' methods resort to either unsupervised or supervised learning to determine hash functions. Recently semi-supervised learning approach was introduced in hashing where pair wise constraints (must link and cannot-link) using labeled data are leveraged while unlabeled data are used for regularization to avoid over-fitting. In this paper we base our semi-supervised hashing on linear discriminant analysis, where hash functions are learned such that labeled data are used to maximize the separability between binary codes associated with different classes while unlabeled data are used for regularization as well as for balancing condition and pair wise decor relation of bits. The resulting method is referred to as semi-supervised discriminant hashing (SSDH). Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods, especially in the case of short binary codes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address important issues of dimensionality reduction of transactional data sets where the input data consists of lists of transactions, each of them being a finite set of items. The reduction consists in finding a small set of new items, so-called factor-items, which is considerably smaller than the original set of items while comprising full or nearly full information about the original items. Using this type of reduction, the original data set can be represented by a smaller transactional data set using factor-items instead of the original items, thus reducing its dimensionality. The procedure utilized in this paper is based on approximate Boolean matrix decomposition. In this paper, we focus on the role of frequent closed item sets that can be used to determine factor-items. We present the factorization problem, its reduction to Boolean matrix decompositions, experiments with publicly available data sets, and an algorithm for computing decompositions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The analysis of software similarity has many applications such as detecting code clones, software plagiarism, code theft, and polymorphic malware. Because often source code is unavailable and code obfuscation is used to avoid detection, there has been much research on developing effective models to capture runtime behavior to aid detection. Existing models focus on low-level information such as dependency or purely occurrence of function calls, and suffer from poor precision, poor scalability, or both. To overcome limitations of existing models, this paper introduces a precise and succinct behavior representation that characterizes high-level object-accessing patterns as regular expressions. We first distill a set of high-level patterns (the alphabet S of the regular language) based on two pieces of information: function call patterns to access objects and type state information of the objects. Then we abstract a runtime trace of a program P into a regular expression e over the pattern alphabet S to produce P's behavior signature. We show that software instances derived from the same code exhibit similar behavior signatures and develop effective algorithms to cluster and match behavior signatures. To evaluate the effectiveness of our behavior model, we have applied it to the similarity analysis of polymorphic malware. Our results on a large malware collection demonstrate that our model is both precise and succinct for effective and scalable matching and detection of polymorphic malware.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Naive Bayesian learning has been popular in data mining applications. However, the performance of naive Bayesian learning is sometimes poor due to the unrealistic assumption that all features are equally important and independent given the class value. Therefore, it is widely known that the performance of naive Bayesian learning can be improved by mitigating this assumption, and many enhancements to the basic naive Bayesian learning have been proposed to resolve this problem including feature selection and feature weighting. In this paper, we propose a new method for calculating the weights of features in naive Bayesian learning using Kullback-Leibler measure. Empirical results are presented comparing this new feature weighting method with some other methods for a number of datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Enhancing diversity in ranking on graphs has been identified as an important retrieval and mining task. Nevertheless, many existing diversified ranking algorithms cannot be scalable to large graphs as they have high time or space complexity. In this paper, we propose a scalable algorithm to find the top-K diversified ranking list on graphs. The key idea of our algorithm is that we first compute the Pagerank of the nodes of the graph, and then perform a carefully designed vertex selection algorithm to find the top-K diversified ranking list. Specifically, we firstly present a new diversified ranking measure, which can capture both relevance and diversity. Secondly, we prove the submodularity of the proposed measure. And then we propose an efficient greedy algorithm with linear time and space complexity with respect to the size of the graph to achieve near-optimal diversified ranking. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method through extensive experiments on four real networks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing diversified ranking algorithms both on improving diversity in ranking and the efficiency of the algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Along with the ever-growing Web, horror contents sharing in the Internet has interfered with our daily life and affected our, especially children's, health. Therefore horror image recognition is becoming more important for web objectionable content filtering. This paper presents a novel context-aware multi-instance learning (CMIL) model for this task. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. Firstly, the traditional multi-instance learning is extended to context-aware multi-instance learning model through integrating an undirected graph in each bag that represents contextual relationships among instances. Secondly, by introducing a novel energy function, a heuristic optimization algorithm based on Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) is given out to find the optimal classifier on CMIL. Finally, the CMIL is applied to recognize horror images. Experimental results on an image set collected from the Internet show that the proposed method is effective on horror image recognition.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose a new variant of supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation(sLDA): mixture of soft max sLDA, for image classification. Ensemble classification methods can combine multiple weak classifiers to construct a strong classifier. Inspired by the ensemble idea, we try to improve sLDA model using the idea. The mixture of soft max model is a probabilistic ensemble classification model, it can fit the training data and class label well. We embed the mixture of soft max model into LDA model under the framwork of sLDA, and construct an ensemble supervised topic model for image classification. Meanwhile, we derive an elegant parameters estimation algorithm based on variational EM method, and give a simple and efficient approximation method for classifying a new image. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing with some existing approaches on two real world datasets. The results show that our model enhances classification accuracy by 7% on the 1600-image Label Me dataset and 9% on the 1791-image UIUC-Sport dataset.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Feature selection with specific multivariate performance measures is the key to the success of many applications, such as information retrieval and bioinformatics. The existing feature selection methods are usually designed for classification error. In this paper, we present a unified feature selection framework for general loss functions. In particular, we study the novel feature selection paradigm by optimizing multivariate performance measures. The resultant formulation is a challenging problem for high-dimensional data. Hence, a two-layer cutting plane algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, and the convergence is presented. Extensive experiments on large-scale and high-dimensional real world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms l<sub>1</sub>-SVM and SVM-RFE when choosing a small subset of features, and achieves significantly improved performances over SVM<sup>perf</sup> in terms of F<sub>1</sub>-score.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Concept-evolution is one of the major challenges in data stream classification, which occurs when a new class evolves in the stream. This problem remains unaddressed by most state-of-the-art techniques. A recurring class is a special case of concept-evolution. This special case takes place when a class appears in the stream, then disappears for a long time, and again appears. Existing data stream classification techniques that address the concept-evolution problem, wrongly detect the recurring classes as novel class. This creates two main problems. First, much resource is wasted in detecting a recurring class as novel class, because novel class detection is much more computationally- and memory-intensive, as compared to simply recognizing an existing class. Second, when a novel class is identified, human experts are involved in collecting and labeling the instances of that class for future modeling. If a recurrent class is reported as novel class, it will be only a waste of human effort to find out whether it is really a novel class. In this paper, we address the recurring issue, and propose a more realistic novel class detection technique, which remembers a class and identifies it as "not novel" when it reappears after a long disappearance. Our approach has shown significant reduction in classification error over state-of-the-art stream classification techniques on several benchmark data streams.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Page Rank has been widely used in ranking retrieval results on the web, finding the top influential papers in citation networks or detecting valuable users in online social networks. However, in practice, it is usually hard to obtain a complete structure of any above networks to rank nodes. Thus, some researchers have begun to explore how to get estimated ranks efficiently without acquiring the whole network. They have proposed some approximating methods, however, it is difficult to determine which method is the best one or which is suitable to a certain application. In this case, we set experiments in small-world and scale-free generated networks to certify the feasibility and characteristics of four approximating methods. We also use eleven real networks to mention different optimal conditions for these methods. We find the DIG Rank method performs better than other local estimation methods in almost every given sub graph. Besides, Mean field approach method tends to perform well in networks that have low average shortest path length, small amount of nodes with the same low in degree, or weak community structure. Finally, we apply the most versatile method DIG Rank to Sina micro-blog website to precisely classify users in a group as elites, grassroots or mummy users.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The increasing interest in dynamically changing networks has led to growing interest in a more general link prediction problem called temporal link prediction in the data mining and machine learning communities. However, only links in identical time frames are considered in temporal link prediction. We propose a new link prediction problem called cross-temporal link prediction in which the links among nodes in different time frames are inferred. A typical example of cross-temporal link prediction is cross-temporal entity resolution to determine the identity of real entities represented by data objects observed in different time periods. In dynamic environments, the features of data change over time, making it difficult to identify cross-temporal links by directly comparing observed data. Other examples of cross-temporal links are asynchronous communications in social networks such as Face book and Twitter, where a message is posted in reply to a previous message. We adopt a dimension reduction approach to cross-temporal link prediction, that is, data objects in different time frames are mapped into a common low-dimensional latent feature space, and the links are identified on the basis of the distance between the data objects. The proposed method uses different low-dimensional feature projections in different time frames, enabling it to adapt to changes in the latent features over time. Using multi-task learning, it jointly learns a set of feature projection matrices from the training data, given the assumption of temporal smoothness of the projections. The optimal solutions are obtained by solving a single generalized eigenvalue problem. Experiments using a real-world set of bibliographic data for cross-temporal entity resolution showed that introducing time-dependent feature projections improves the accuracy of link prediction.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The omnipresence of mobile sensors has brought tremendous opportunities to ubiquitous computing systems. In many natural settings, however, their broader applications are hindered by three main challenges: rarity of labels, uncertainty of activity granularities, and the difficulty of multi-dimensional sensor fusion. In this paper, we propose building a grammar to address all these challenges using a language-based approach. The proposed algorithm, called Helix, first generates an initial vocabulary using unlabeled sensor readings, followed by iteratively combining statistically collocated sub-activities across sensor dimensions and grouping similar activities together to discover higher level activities. The experiments using a 20-minute ping-pong game demonstrate favorable results compared to a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) baseline. Closer investigations to the learned grammar also shows that the learned grammar captures the natural structure of the underlying activities.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Large graphs are difficult to represent, visualize, and understand. In this paper, we introduce "gate graph" a new approach to perform graph simplification. A gate graph provides a simplified topological view of the original graph. Specifically, we construct a gate graph from a large graph so that for any "non-local" vertex pair (distance greater than some threshold) in the original graph, their shortest-path distance can be recovered by consecutive "local" walks through the gate vertices in the gate graph. We perform a theoretical investigation on the gate-vertex set discovery problem. We characterize its computational complexity and reveal the upper bound of minimum gate- vertex set using VC-dimension theory. We propose an efficient mining algorithm to discover a gate-vertex set with guaranteed logarithmic bound. The detailed experimental results using both real and synthetic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many clustering applications the incorporation of background knowledge in the form of constraints is desirable. In this paper, we introduce a new constraint type and the corresponding clustering problem: attribute constrained clustering. The goal is to induce clusters of binary instances that satisfy constraints on the attribute level. These constraints specify whether instances may or may not be grouped to a cluster, depending on specific attribute values. We show how the well-established instance-level constraints, must-link and cannot-link, can be adapted to the attribute level. A variant of the k-Medoids algorithm taking into account attribute level constraints is evaluated on synthetic and real-world data. Experimental results show that such constraints may provide better clustering results at lower specification costs if constraints can be expressed on the attribute level.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present in this paper a new clustering algorithm for multivariate data. This algorithm, called BOOL (Binary coding Oriented clustering), can detect arbitrarily shaped clusters and is noise tolerant. BOOL handles data using a two-step procedure: data points are first discretized and represented as binary words, clusters are then iteratively constructed by agglomerating smaller clusters using this representation. This latter step is carried out with linear complexity by sorting such binary representations, which results in dramatic speedups when compared with other techniques. Experiments show that BOOL is faster than K-means, and about two to three orders of magnitude faster than two state-of-the-art algorithms that can detect non-convex clusters of arbitrary shapes. We also show that BOOL's results are robust to changes in parameters, whereas most algorithms for arbitrarily shaped clusters are known to be overly sensitive to such changes. The key to the robustness of BOOL is the hierarchical structure of clusters that is introduced automatically by increasing the accuracy of the discretization.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Personalized activity recognition usually faces the problem of data sparseness. We aim at improving accuracy of personalized activity recognition by incorporating the information from other persons. We propose a new online multi-task learning method for personalized activity recognition. The proposed online multi-task learning method automatically learns the ``transfer-factors" (similarities) among different tasks (i.e., among different persons in our case). Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods. The novelty of this paper is twofold: (1) A new multi-task learning framework, which can naturally learn similarities among tasks, (2) To our knowledge, this is the first study of large-scale personalized activity recognition.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Privacy in social network data publishing is always an important concern. Nowadays most prior privacy protection techniques focus on static social networks. However, there are additional privacy disclosures in dynamic social networks due to the sequential publications. In this paper, we first show that the risks of vertex and community re-identification exist in a dynamic social network, even if the release at each time instance is protected by a static anonymity scheme. To prevent vertex and community re-identification in a dynamic social network, we propose novel dynamic k<sup>w</sup>-structural diversity anonymity, where w is the time that an adversary can monitor a victim. This scheme extends the k-structural diversity anonymity to a dynamic scenario. We also present a heuristic to anonymize the releases of networks to satisfy the proposed privacy scheme. The evaluations show that our approach can retain much of the characteristics of the networks while confirming the privacy protection.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Detection of emerging topics are now receiving renewed interest motivated by the rapid growth of social networks. Conventional term-frequency-based approaches may not be appropriate in this context, because the information exchanged are not only texts but also images, URLs, and videos. We focus on the social aspects of theses networks. That is, the links between users that are generated dynamically intentionally or unintentionally through replies, mentions, and retweets. We propose a probability model of the mentioning behaviour of a social network user, and propose to detect the emergence of a new topic from the anomaly measured through the model. We combine the proposed mention anomaly score with a recently proposed change-point detection technique based on the Sequentially Discounting Normalized Maximum Likelihood (SDNML), or with Kleinberg's burst model. Aggregating anomaly scores from hundreds of users, we show that we can detect emerging topics only based on the reply/mention relationships in social network posts. We demonstrate our technique in a number of real data sets we gathered from Twitter. The experiments show that the proposed mention-anomaly-based approaches can detect new topics at least as early as the conventional term-frequency-based approach, and sometimes much earlier when the keyword is ill-defined.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Communities are natural structures observed in social networks and are usually characterized as "relatively dense" subsets of nodes. Social networks change over time and so do the underlying community structures. Thus, to truly uncover this structure we must take the temporal aspect of networks into consideration. Previously, we have represented framework for finding dynamic communities using the social cost model and formulated the corresponding optimization problem [33], assuming that partitions of individuals into groups are given in each time step. We have also presented heuristics and approximation algorithms for the problem, with the same assumption [32]. In general, however, dynamic social networks are represented as a sequence of graphs of snapshots of the social network and the assumption that we have partitions of individuals into groups does not hold. In this paper, we extend the social cost model and formulate an optimization problem of finding community structure from the sequence of arbitrary graphs. We propose a semi definite programming formulation and a heuristic rounding scheme. We show, using synthetic data sets, that this method is quite accurate on synthetic data sets and present its results on a real social network.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Online reviews provide valuable information about products and services to consumers. However, spammers are joining the community trying to mislead readers by writing fake reviews. Previous attempts for spammer detection used reviewers' behaviors, text similarity, linguistics features and rating patterns. Those studies are able to identify certain types of spammers, e.g., those who post many similar reviews about one target entity. However, in reality, there are other kinds of spammers who can manipulate their behaviors to act just like genuine reviewers, and thus cannot be detected by the available techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of a heterogeneous review graph to capture the relationships among reviewers, reviews and stores that the reviewers have reviewed. We explore how interactions between nodes in this graph can reveal the cause of spam and propose an iterative model to identify suspicious reviewers. This is the first time such intricate relationships have been identified for review spam detection. We also develop an effective computation method to quantify the trustiness of reviewers, the honesty of reviews, and the reliability of stores. Different from existing approaches, we don't use review text information. Our model is thus complementary to existing approaches and able to find more difficult and subtle spamming activities, which are agreed upon by human judges after they evaluate our results.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A new learning algorithm for categorical data, named CRN (Classification by Rule-based Neighbors) is proposed in this paper. CRN is a nonmetric and parameter-free classifier, and can be regarded as a hybrid of rule induction and instance-based learning. Based on a new measure of attributes quality and the separate-and-conquer strategy, CRN learns a collection of feature sets such that for each pair of instances belonging to different classes, there is a feature set on which the two instances disagree. For an unlabeled instance I and a labeled instance I', I' is a neighbor of I if and only if they agree on all attributes of a feature set. Then, CRN classifies an unlabeled instance I based on I's neighbors on those learned feature sets. To validate the performance of CRN, CRN is compared with six state-of-the-art classifiers on twenty-four datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that although the underlying idea of CRN is simple, the predictive accuracy of CRN is comparable to or better than that of the state-of-the-art classifiers on most datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Social tagging predictions involve the co occurrence of users, items and tags. The tremendous growth of users require the recommender system to produce tag recommendations for millions of users and items at any minute. The triplets of users, items and tags are most naturally described by a 3D tensor, and tensor decomposition-based algorithms can produce high quality recommendations. However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, Para Fac, and Low-order tensor decompositions. We show that these algorithm can very efficiently compute the needed decompositions. We evaluate the fold-in algorithms experimentally on several datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One category of videos usually contains the same thematic pattern, e.g., the spin action in skating videos. The discovery of the thematic pattern is essential to understand and summarize the video contents. This paper addresses two critical issues in mining thematic video patterns: (1) automatic discovery of thematic patterns without any training or supervision information, and (2) accurate localization of the occurrences of all thematic patterns in videos. The major contributions are two-fold. First, we formulate the thematic video pattern discovery as a cohesive sub-graph selection problem by finding a sub-set of visual words that are spatio-temporally collocated. Then spatio-temporal branch-and-bound search can locate all instances accurately. Second, a novel method is proposed to efficiently find the cohesive sub-graph of maximum overall mutual information scores. Our experimental results on challenging commercial and action videos show that our approach can discover different types of thematic patterns despite variations in scale, view-point, color and lighting conditions, or partial occlusions. Our approach is also robust to the videos with cluttered and dynamic backgrounds.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we present a semi-supervised method to learn a low rank Mahalanobis distance function. Based on an approximation to the projection distance from a manifold, we propose a novel parametric manifold regularizer. In contrast to previous approaches that usually exploit side information only, our proposed method can further take advantages of the intrinsic manifold information from data. In addition, we focus on learning a metric of low rank directly, this is different from traditional approaches that often enforce the l<sub>1</sub> norm on the metric. The resulting configuration is convex with respect to the manifold structure and the distance function, respectively. We solve it with an alternating optimization algorithm, which proves effective to find a satisfactory solution. For efficient implementation, we even present a fast algorithm, in which the manifold structure and the distance function are learned independently without alternating minimization. Experimental results over 12 standard UCI data sets demonstrate the advantages of our method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The spectrum of graph has been widely used in graph mining to extract graph topological information. It has also been employed as a characteristic of graph to check the sub graph isomorphism testing since it is an invariant of a graph. However, the spectrum cannot be directly applied to a graph and its sub graph, which is a bottleneck for sub graph isomorphism testing. In this paper, we study the Laplacian spectra between a graph and its sub graph, and propose a method by straightforward adoption of them for sub graph queries. In our proposed method, we first encode every vertex and graph by extracting their Laplacian spectra, and generate a novel two-step filtering conditions. Then, we follow the filtering-and verification framework to conduct sub graph queries. Extensive experiments show that, compared with existing counterpart method, as a graph feature, Laplacian spectra can be used to efficiently improves the efficiency of sub graph queries and thus indicate that it have considerable potential.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Semi-supervised nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)receives more and more attention in text mining field. The semi-supervised NMF methods can be divided into two types, one is based on the explicit category labels, the other is based on the pair wise constraints including must-link and cannot-link. As it is hard to obtain the category labels in some tasks, the latter one is more widely used in real applications. To date, all the constrained NMF methods treat the must-link and cannot-link constraints in a same way. However, these two kinds of constraints play different roles in NMF clustering. Thus a novel constrained NMF method is proposed in this paper. In the new method, must-link constraints are used to control the distance of the data in the compressed form, and cannot-ink constraints are used to control the encoding factor. Experimental results on real-world text data sets have shown the good performance of the proposed method.</p>
