<p>【Abstract】:
How do we scale information extraction to the massive size and unprecedented heterogeneity of the Web corpus? Beginning in 2003, our KnowItAll project has sought to extract high-quality knowledge from the Web. In 2007, we introduced the Open Information Extraction (Open IE) paradigm which eschews handlabeled training examples, and avoids domain-specific verbs and nouns, to develop unlexicalized, domain-independent extractors that scale to the Web corpus. Open IE systems have extracted billions of assertions as the basis for both common-sense knowledge and novel question-answering systems. This paper describes the second generation of Open IE systems, which rely on a novel model of how relations and their arguments are expressed in English sentences to double precision/recall compared with previous systems such as TEXTRUNNER and WOE.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Research in AI has built upon the tools and techniques of many different disciplines, including formal logic, probability theory, decision theory, management science, linguistics and philosophy. However, the application of these disciplines in AI has necessitated the development of many enhancements and extensions. Among the most powerful of these are the methods of computational logic. I will argue that computational logic, embedded in an agent cycle, combines and improves upon both traditional logic and classical decision theory. I will also argue that many of its methods can be used, not only in AI, but also in ordinary life, to help people improve their own human intelligence without the assistance of computers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many collective decision making problems have a combinatorial structure: the agents involved must decide on multiple issues and their preferences over one issue may depend on the choices adopted for some of the others. Voting is an attractive method for making collective decisions, but conducting a multi-issue election is challenging. On the one hand, requiring agents to vote by expressing their preferences over all combinations of issues is computationally infeasible; on the other, decomposing the problem into several elections on smaller sets of issues can lead to paradoxical outcomes. Any pragmatic method for running a multi-issue election will have to balance these two concerns. We identify and analyse the problem of generating an agenda for a given election, specifying which issues to vote on together in local elections and in which order to schedule those local elections.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a novel methodology for decision-making by computer agents that leverages a computational concept of emotions. It is believed that emotions help living organisms perform well in complex environments. Can we use them to improve the decision-making performance of computer agents? We explore this possibility by formulating emotions as mathematical operators that serve to update the relative priorities of the agent's goals. The agent uses rudimentary domain knowledge to monitor the expectation that its goals are going to be accomplished in the future, and reacts to changes in this expectation by "experiencing emotions." The end result is a projection of the agent's long-run utility function, which might be too complex to optimize or even represent, to a time-varying valuation function that is being myopically maximized by selecting appropriate actions. Our methodology provides a systematic way to incorporate emotion into a decision-theoretic framework, and also provides a principled, domain-independent methodology for generating heuristics in novel situations. We test our agents in simulation in two domains: restless bandits and a simple foraging environment. Our results indicate that emotion-based agents outperform other reasonable heuristics for such difficult domains, and closely approach computationally expensive near-optimal solutions, whenever these are computable, yet requiring only a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study repeated games in which players have imperfect execution skill and one player's true skill is not common knowledge. In these settings the possibility arises of a player "hustling," or pretending to have lower execution skill than they actually have. Focusing on repeated zero-sum games, we provide a hustle-proof strategy; this strategy maximizes a player's payoff, regardless of the true skill level of the other player.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
An important task in the analysis of multiagent systems is to understand how groups of selfish players can form coalitions, i.e., work together in teams. In this paper, we study the dynamics of coalition formation under bounded rationality. We consider settings where each team's profit is given by a concave function, and propose three profit-sharing schemes, each of which is based on the concept of marginal utility. The agents are assumed to be myopic, i.e., they keep changing teams as long as they can increase their payoff by doing so. We study the properties (such as closeness to Nash equilibrium or total profit) of the states that result after a polynomial number of such moves, and prove bounds on the price of anarchy and the price of stability of the corresponding games.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We conduct a computational analysis of fair and optimal partitions in additively separable hedonic games. We show that, for strict preferences, a Pareto optimal partition can be found in polynomial time while verifying whether a given partition is Pareto optimal is coNP-complete, even when preferences are symmetric and strict. Moreover, computing a partition with maximum egalitarian or utilitarian social welfare or one which is both Pareto optimal and individually rational is NP-hard. We also prove that checking whether there exists a partition which is both Pareto optimal and envy-free is Σ2p-complete. Even though an envy-free partition and a Nash stable partition are both guaranteed to exist for symmetric preferences, checking whether there exists a partition which is both envy-free and Nash stable is NP-complete.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Computational social choice literature has successfully studied the complexity of manipulation in variousvoting systems. However, the existing modelsof coalitional manipulation view the manipulatingcoalition as an exogenous input, ignoring thequestion of the coalition formation process. While such analysis is useful as a first approximation, a richer framework is required to model voting manipulationin the real world more accurately, and, inparticular, to explain how a manipulating coalitionarises and chooses its action. In this paper, we apply tools from cooperative game theory to developa model that considers the coalition formation processand determines which coalitions are likely toform and what actions they are likely to take. We explore the computational complexity of several standard coalitional game theory solution concepts in our setting, and study the relationship betweenour model and the classic coalitional manipulation problem as well as the now-standard bribery model.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Borda voting rule is a positional scoring rule where, for m candidates, for every vote the first candidate receives m-1 points, the second m-2 points and so on. A Borda winner is a candidate with highest total score. It has been a prominent open problem to determine the computational complexity of Unweighted Coalitional Manipulation under Borda: Can one add a certain number of additional votes (called manipulators) to an election such that a distinguished candidate becomes a winner? We settle this open problem by showing NP-hardness even for two manipulators and three input votes. Moreover, we discuss extensions and limitations of this hardness result.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Grammatical agreement is present in many of the world's languages today and has become an essential feature that guides linguistic processing. When two words in a sentence are said to "agree," this means that they share certain features such as "gender," "number," "person" or others. The primary hypothesis of this paper is that marking agreement within one linguistic phrase reduces processing effort as phrasal constituents can more easily be recognized. The drive to reduce processing effort introduces the rise of agreement marking in a population of multiple agents by means of an incrementally aligned mapping between the most discriminatory features of a particular linguistic unit and their associative markers. A series of experiments compare feature selection methods for one-to-one agreement mappings, and show how an agreement system can be bootstrapped.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The classic Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem establishes that only dictatorial voting rules are strategy-proof; under any other voting rule, players have an incentive to lie about their true preferences. We consider a new approach for circumventing this result: we consider randomized voting rules that only approximate a deterministic voting rule and only are approximately strategy-proof. We show that any deterministic voting rule can be approximated by an approximately strategy-proof randomized voting rule, and we provide asymptotically tight lower bounds on the parameters required by such voting rules.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the following sequential allocation process. A benevolent central authority has to allocate a set of indivisible goods to a set of agents whose preferences it is totally ignorant of. We consider the process of allocating objects one after the other by designating an agent and asking her to pick one of the objects among those that remain. The problem consists in choosing the "best" sequence of agents, according to some optimality criterion. We assume that agents have additive preferences over objects. The choice of an optimality criterion depends on three parameters: how utilities of objects are related to their ranking in an agent's preference relation; how the preferences of different agents are correlated; and how social welfare is defined from the agents' utilities. We address the computation of a sequence maximizing expected social welfare under several assumptions. We also address strategical issues.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
An important problem in voting is that agents may misrepresent their preferences in order to obtain a more preferred outcome. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has been shown to be inevitable in the case of resolute, i.e., single-valued, social choice functions. In this paper, we introduce a variant of Maskin-monotonicity that completely characterizes the class of pairwise irresolute social choice functions that are group-strategyproof according to Kelly's preference extension.The class is narrow but contains a number of appealing Condorcet extensions such as the minimal covering set and the bipartisan set, thereby answering a question raised independently by Barbera (1977) and Kelly (1977). These functions furthermore encourage participation and thus do not suffer from the no-show paradox (under Kelly's extension).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tournament solutions, i.e., functions that associate with each complete and asymmetric relation on a set of alternatives a non-empty subset of the alternatives, play an important role within social choice theory and the mathematical social sciences at large. Laffond et al. have shown that various tournament solutions satisfy composition-consistency, a structural invariance property based on the similarity of alternatives. We define the decomposition degree of a tournament as a parameter that reflects its decomposability and show that computing any composition-consistent tournament solution is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the decomposition degree. Furthermore, we experimentally investigate the decomposition degree of two natural distributions of tournaments and its impact on the running time of computing the tournament equilibrium set.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we introduce and analyze social distance games, a family of non-transferable utility coalitional games where an agent's utility is a measure of closeness to the other members of the coalition. We study both social welfare maximisation and stability in these games using a graph theoretic perspective. We use the stability gap to investigate the welfare of stable coalition structures, and propose two new solution concepts with improved welfare guarantees. We argue that social distance games are both interesting in themselves, as well as in the context of social networks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many multi-agent systems, the emergence of norms is the primary factor that determines overall behavior and utility. Agent simulations can be used to predict and study the development of these norms. However, a large number of simulations is usually required to provide an accurate depiction of the agents’ behavior, and some rare contingencies may still be overlooked completely. The cost and risk involvedwith agent simulations can be reduced by analyzing a system theoretically and producing models of its behavior. We use such a theoretical approach to examine the dynamics of a population of agents playing a coordination game to determine all the norms to which the society can converge, and develop a system of linear recurrence relations that predict how frequently each of these norms will be reached, as well as the average convergence time. This analysis produces certain guarantees about system behavior that canot be provided by a purely empirical approach, and can be used to make predictions about the emergence of norms that numerically match those obtained through large-scale simulations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The environment is an essential component of multi-agent systems and is often used to coordinate the behaviour of individualagents. Recently many languages have been proposed to specify and implement multi-agent environments in terms of social and normative concepts. In this paper, we first introduce a formal setting of multi-agent environment which abstracts from concrete specification languages. We extend this formal setting with norms and sanctions and show how concepts from mechanism design can be used to formally analyse and verify whether specific normative behaviours can be enforced (or implemented) if agents follow their subjective preferences. We also consider complexity issues of associated problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Alternating-time temporal logic (ATL) is a well-known logic for reasoning about strategic abilities of agents. An important feature that distinguishes variants of ATL for imperfect information scenarios is that the standard fixed point characterizations of temporal modalities do not hold anymore. In this paper, we show that adding explicit fixed point operators to the "next-time" fragment of ATL already allows to capture abilities that could not be expressed in ATL. We also illustrate that the new language allows to specify important kinds of abilities, namely ones where the agents can always recompute their strategy while executing it. Thus, the agents are not assumed to remember their strategy by definition, like in the existing variants of ATL. Last but not least, we show that verification of such abilities can be cheaper than for all the variants of `"ATL with imperfect information" considered so far.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Trust is crucial in dynamic multi-agent systems, where agents may frequently join and leave, and the structure of the society may often change. In these environments, it may be difficult for agents to form stable trust relationships necessary for confident interactions. Societies may break down when trust between agents is too low to motivate interactions. In such settings, agents should make decisions about who to interact with, given their degree of trust in the available partners. We propose a decision-theoretic model of trust decision making allows controls to be used, as well as trust, to increase confidence in initial interactions. We consider explicit incentives, monitoring and reputation as examples of such controls. We evaluate our approach within a simulated, highly-dynamic multi-agent environment, and show how this model supports the making of delegation decisions when trust is low.</p>

Given an argumentation framework and a group of agents, the individuals may have divergent opinions on the status of the arguments.

Thisproblem has been recently investigated by Caminada and Pigozzi. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of two of such operators from a socialchoice-theoretic point of view. In particular, we study under which conditions these operators are Pareto optimal and whether they are manipulable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Cake cutting is a playful name for the problem of fairly dividing a heterogeneous divisible good among a set of agents. The agent valuations for different pieces of cake are typically assumed to be additive. However, in certain practical settings this assumption is invalid because agents may not have positive value for arbitrarily small "crumbs" of cake. In this paper, we propose a new, more expressive model of agent valuations that captures this feature. We present an approximately proportional algorithm for any number of agents that have such expressive valuations. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that no other algorithm can guarantee a greater worst-case degree of proportionality. We also design an optimal approximately proportional and fully envy-free algorithm for two agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There is a fundamental incompatibility between efficiency, interim individual rationality, and budget-balance in mechanism design, even for extremely simple settings. Yet it is possible to specify efficient mechanisms that satisfy participation and budget-balance constraints in expectation, prior to types being realized. We do so here, in fact deriving mechanisms that are individually rational for each agent even ex post of other agents' type realizations. However, participation must still bear some risk of loss. For agents that are risk neutral, we show how the center can extract the entire surplus in expectation, or alternatively provide an equal expected share of the surplus for each participant, without violating dominant strategy incentive compatibility, efficiency, or ex ante budget-balance. We compare these solutions to a third efficient mechanism we design explicitly to address risk aversion in trade settings: payments are defined to minimize the odds of loss, satisfying ex ante participation constraints for agents with attitudes toward risk ranging from neutrality to high loss-aversion.</p>

In this paper we propose a mechanism that encourages agents, participating in an open MAS, to follow a desirable behaviour, by introducing modifications in the environment. This mechanism is deployed by using an infrastructure based on institutional agents called incentivators. Each external agent is assigned to an incentivator that is able to discover its preferences, and to learn the suitable modifications in the environment, in order to improve the global utility of a system in response to inadequate design or changes in the population of participating agents. The mechanism is evaluated in a p2p scenario.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The social lending market, with over a billion dollars in loans, is a two-sided matching market where borrowers specify demands and lenders specify total budgets and their desired interest rates from each acceptable borrower. Because different borrowers correspond to different risk-return profiles, lenders have preferences over acceptable borrowers; a borrower prefers lenders in order of the interest rates they offer to her. We investigate the question of what is a computationally feasible, 'good', allocation to clear this market. We design a strongly polynomial time algorithm for computing a Pareto-efficient stable outcome in a two-sided many-to-many matching market within differences, and use this to compute an allocation for the social lending market that satisfies the properties of stability — a standard notion of fairness in two-sided matching markets — and Pareto efficiency; and additionally addresses envy-freeness amongst similar borrowers and risk diversification for lenders.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider a framework for preference aggregation on multiple binary issues, where agents' preferences are represented by (possibly cyclic) CP-nets. We focus on the majority aggregation of the individual CP-nets, which is the CP-net where the direction of each edge of the hypercube is decided according to the majority rule. First we focus on hypercube Condorcet winners (HCWs); in particular, we show that, assuming a uniform distribution for the CP-nets, the probability that there exists at least one HCW is at least 1-1/e, and the expected number of HCWs is 1. Our experimental results confirm these results. We also show experimental results under the Impartial Culture assumption. We then generalize a few tournament solutions to select winners from (weighted) majoritarian CP-nets, namely Copeland, maximin, and Kemeny. For each of these, we address some social choice theoretic and computational issues.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address the issue, in cognitive agents, of possible loss of previous information, which later might turn out to be correct when new information becomes available. To this aim, we propose a framework for changing the agent's mind without erasing forever previous information, thus allowing its recovery in case the change turns out to be wrong. In this new framework, a piece of information is represented as an argument which can be more or less accepted depending on the trustworthiness of the agent who proposes it. We adopt possibility theory to represent uncertainty about the information, and to model the fact that information sources can be only partially trusted. The originality of the proposed framework lies in the following two points: (i) argument reinstatement is mirrored in belief reinstatement in order to avoid the loss of previous information; (ii) new incoming information is represented under the form of arguments and it is associated with a plausibility degree depending on the trustworthiness of the information source.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider scenarios where several agents must aggregate their preferences over a large set of candidates with a combinatorial structure. That is, each candidate is an element of the Cartesian product of the domains of some variables. We assume agents compactly express their preferences over the candidates via soft constraints. We consider a sequential procedure that chooses one candidate by asking the agents to vote on one variable at a time. While some properties of this procedure have been already studied, here we focus on independence of irrelevant alternatives, non-dictatorship, and strategy-proofness. Also, we perform an experimental study that shows that the proposed sequential procedure yields a considerable saving in time with respect to a non-sequential approach, while the winners satisfy the agents just as well, independently of the variable ordering and of the presence of coalitions of agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We report on results from experiments where human traders interact with software-agent traders in a real-time asynchronous continuous double auction (CDA) experimental economics system. Our experiments are inspired by the seminal work reported by IBM at IJCAI 2001, where it was demonstrated that software-agent traders could consistently outperform human traders in real-time CDA markets. IBM tested two trading-agent strategies, ZIP and a modified version of GD, and in a subsequent paper they reported on a new strategy called GDX that was demonstrated to outperform GD and ZIP in agent vs. agent CDA competitions, on which basis it was claimed that GDX "...may offer the best performance of any published CDA bidding strategy.". In this paper, we employ experiment methods similar to those pioneered by IBM to test the performance of "Adaptive Aggressive" (AA) algorithmic traders. The results presented here confirm Vytelingum's claim that AA outperforms ZIP, GD, and GDX in agent vs. agent experiments. We then present the first results from testing AA against human traders in human vs. agent CDA experiments, and demonstrate that AA's performance against human traders is superior to that of ZIP, GD, and GDX. We therefore claim that, on the basis of the available evidence, AA may offer the best performance of any published bidding strategy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In elections, an alternative is said to be a Condorcet winner if it is preferred to any other alternative by a majority of voters. While this is a very attractive solution concept, many elections do not have a Condorcet winner. In this paper, we propose a setvalued relaxation of this concept, which we call a Condorcet winning set: such sets consist of alternatives that collectively dominate any other alternative. We also consider a more general version of this concept, where instead of domination by a majority of voters we require domination by a given fraction theta of voters; we refer to this concept as theta-winning set. We explore social choice-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of these solution concepts, both theoretically and empirically.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The RoboCup robot soccer Small Size League has been running since 1997 with many teams successfully competiting and very effectively playing the games. Teams of five robots, with a combined autonomous centralized perception and control, and distributed actuation, move at high speeds in the field space, actuating a golf ball by passing and shooting it to aim at scoring goals. Most teams run their own pre-defined team strategies, unknown to the other teams, with flexible game-state dependent assignment of robot roles and positioning. However, in this fast-paced noisy real robot league, recognizing the opponent team strategies and accordingly adapting one's own play has proven to be a considerable challenge. In this work, we analyze logged data of real games gathered by the CMDragons team, and contribute several results in learning and responding to opponent strategies. We define episodes as segments of interest in the logged data, and introduce a representation that captures the spatial and temporal data of the multi-robot system as instances of geometrical trajectory curves. We then learn a model of the team strategies through a variant of agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Using the learned cluster model, we are able to classify a team behavior incrementally as it occurs. Finally, we define an algorithm that autonomously generates counter tactics, in a simulation based on the real logs, showing that it can recognize and respond to opponent strategies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Binary aggregation studies problems in which individuals express yes/no choices over a number of possibly correlated issues, and these individual choices need to be aggregated into a collective choice. We show how several classical frameworks of Social Choice Theory, particularly preference and judgment aggregation, can be viewed as binary aggregation problems by designing an appropriate set of integrity constraints for each specific setting. We explore the generality of this framework, showing that it makes available useful techniques both to prove theoretical results, such as a new impossibility theorem in preference aggregation, and to analyse practical problems, such as the characterisation of safe agendas in judgment aggregation in a syntactic way. The framework also allows us to formulate a general definition of paradox that is independent of the domain under consideration, which gives rise to the study of the class of aggregation procedures of generalised dictatorships.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address the issue of manipulating games through communication. In the specific setting we consider (a variation of Boolean games), we assume there is some set of environment variables, the value of which is not directly accessible to players; each player has their own beliefs about these variables, and makes decisions about what actions to perform based on these beliefs. The communication we consider takes the form of (truthful) announcements about the value of some environment variables; the effect of an announcement about some variable is to modify the beliefs of the players who hear the announcement so that they accurately reflect the value of the announced variables. By choosing announcements appropriately, it is possible to perturb the game away from certain rational outcomes and towards others. We specifically focus on the issue of stabilisation: making announcements that transform a game from having no stable states to one that has stable configurations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The computational complexity of relevant corerelatedquestions for coalitional games is addressed from the coalition structure viewpoint, i.e., withoutassuming that the grand-coalition necessarily forms. In the analysis, games are assumed to be in "compact" form, i.e., their worth functions are implicitly given as polynomial-time computable functions over succinct game encodings provided as input. Within this setting, a complete picture of the complexity issues arising with the core, as well as with the related stability concepts of least core and cost of stability, is depicted. In particular, the special cases of superadditive games and of games whose sets of feasible coalitions are restricted over tree-like interaction graphs are also studied.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In binary-utility games, an agent can have only two possible utility values for final states, 1 (win) and 0 (lose). An adversarial binaryutility game is one where for each final state there must be at least one winning and one losing agent. We define an unbiased rational agent as one that seeks to maximize its utility value, but is equally likely to choose between states with the same utility value. This induces a probability distribution over the outcomes of the game, from which an agent can infer its probability to win. A single adversary binary game is one where there are only two possible outcomes, so that the winning probabilities remain binary values. In this case, the rational action for an agent is to play minimax. In this work we focus on the more complex, multiple-adversary environment. We propose a new algorithmic framework where agents try to maximize their winning probabilities. We begin by theoretically analyzing why an unbiased rational agent should take our approach in an unbounded environment and not that of the existing Paranoid or MaxN algorithms. We then expand our framework to a resource-bounded environment, where winning probabilities are estimated, and show empirical results supporting our claims.</p>

We propose a logical framework to represent and reason about agent interactions in normative systems. Our starting point is a dynamic logic of propositional assignments whose satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. We show that it embeds Coalition Logic of Propositional Control CL-PC and that various notions of ability and capability can be captured in it. We illustrate it on a water resource management case study. Finally, we show how the logic can be easily extended in order to represent constitutive rules which are also an essential component of the modelling of social reality.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study the existence and computational complexity of coalitional stability concepts based on social networks. Our concepts represent a natural and rich combinatorial generalization of a recent notion termed partition equilibrium. We assume that players in a strategic game are embedded in a social (or, communication) network, and there are coordination constraints defining the set of coalitions that can jointly deviate in the game. A main feature of our approach is that players act in a "considerate" fashion to ignore potentially profitable (group) deviations if the change in their strategy may cause a decrease of utility to their neighbors in the network. We explore the properties of such considerate equilibria in application to the celebrated class of resource selection games (RSGs). Our main result proves existence of a super-strong considerate equilibrium in all symmetric RSGs with strictly increasing delays, for any social network among the players and feasible coalitions represented by the set of cliques. The existence proof is constructive and yields an efficient algorithm. In fact, the computed considerate equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium for a standard RSG, thus showing that there exists a state that is stable against selfish and considerate behavior simultaneously. Furthermore, we provide results on convergence of considerate dynamics.</p>

In a pursuit-evasion game, one or more pursuers aim to discover the existence of, and then capture, an evader.

Slinko and White, (2008) have recently introduced a new model of coalitional manipulation of voting rules under limited communication, which they call safe strategic voting. The computational aspects of this model were first studied by Hazon and Elkind, (2010), who provide polynomial-time algorithms for finding a safe strategic vote under k-approval and the Bucklin rule. In this paper, we answer an open question of Hazon and Elkind, (2010) by presenting a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a safe strategic vote under the Borda rule. Our results for Borda generalize to several interesting classes of scoring rules.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One fundamental evaluation criteria of an AI technique is its performance in the worst-case. For static strategies in extensive games, this can be computed using a best response computation. Conventionally, this requires a full game tree traversal. For very large games, such as poker, that traversal is infeasible to perform on modern hardware. In this paper, we detail a general technique for best response computations that can often avoid a full game tree traversal. Additionally, our method is specifically well-suited for parallel environments. We apply this approach to computing the worst-case performance of a number of strategies in heads-up limit Texas hold'em, which, prior to this work, was not possible. We explore these results thoroughly as they provide insight into the effects of abstraction on worst-case performance in large imperfect information games. This is a topic that has received much attention, but could not previously be examined outside of toy domains.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Car pollution is one of the major causes of green-house emissions, and traffic congestion is rapidly becoming a social plague. Dynamic Ride Sharing (DRS) systems have the potential to mitigate this problem by computing plans for car drivers, e.g. commuters, allowing them to share their rides. Existing efforts in DRS are suffering from the problem that participants are abandoning the system after repeatedly failing to get a shared ride. In this paper we present an incentive compatible DRS solution based on auctions. While existing DRS systems are mainly focusing on fixed assignments that min- imize the totally travelled distance, the presented approach is adaptive to individual preferences of the participants. Furthermore, our system allows to tradeoff the minimization of Vehicle Kilometers Travelled (VKT) with the overall probability of successful ride-shares, which is an important fea- ture when bootstrapping the system. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a DRS solution based on auctions using a sealed-bid second price scheme.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Algorithms for finding game-theoretic solutions are now used in several real-world security applications. This work has generally assumed a Stackelberg model where the defender commits to a mixed strategy first. In general two-player normal-form games, Stackelberg strategies are easier to compute than Nash equilibria, though it has recently been shown that in many security games, Stackelberg strategies are also Nash strategies for the defender. However, the work on security games so far assumes that the attacker attacks only a single target. In this paper, we generalize to the case where the attacker attacks multiple targets simultaneously. Here, Stackelberg and Nash strategies for the defender can be truly different. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium. The algorithm gradually increases the number of defender resources and maintains an equilibrium throughout this process. Moreover, we prove that Nash equilibria in security games with multiple attackers satisfy the interchange property, which resolves the problem of equilibrium selection in such games. On the other hand, we show that Stackelberg strategies are actually NP-hard to compute in this context. Finally, we provide experimental results.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We develop a general framework for social choice problems in which a limited number of alternatives can be recommended to an agent population. In our budgeted social choice model, this limit is determined by a budget, capturing problems that arise naturally in a variety of contexts, and spanning the continuum from pure consensus decision making (i.e., standard social choice) to fully personalized recommendation. Our approach applies a form of segmentation to social choice problems— requiring the selection of diverse options tailored to different agent types—and generalizes certain multi-winner election schemes. We show that standard rank aggregation methods perform poorly, and that optimization in our model is NP-complete; but we develop fast greedy algorithms with some theoretical guarantees. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
While voting schemes provide an effective means for aggregating preferences, methods for the effective elicitation of voter preferences have received little attention. We address this problem by first considering approximate winner determination when incomplete voter preferences are provided. Exploiting natural scoring metrics, we use max regret to measure the quality or robustness of proposed winners, and develop polynomial time algorithms for computing the alternative with minimax regret for several popular voting rules. We then show how minimax regret can be used to effectively drive incremental preference/vote elicitation and devise several heuristics for this process. Despite worst-case theoretical results showing that most voting protocols require nearly complete voter preferences to determine winners, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of regret-based elicitation for determining both approximate and exact winners on several real-world data sets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Cooperative path-finding can be abstracted as computing non-colliding paths for multiple agents between their start and goal locations on a graph. This paper proposes a fast algorithm that can provide completeness guarantees for a general class of problems without any assumptions about the graph's topology. Specifically, the approach can address any solvable instance where there are at most n-2 agents in a graph of size n. The algorithm employs two primitives: a "push" operation where agents move towards their goals up to the point that no progress can be made, and a "swap" operation that allows two agents to swap positions without altering the configuration of other agents. Simulated experiments are provided on hard instances of cooperative path-finding, including comparisons against alternative methods. The results are favorable for the proposed algorithm and show that the technique scales to problems that require high levels of coordination, involving hundreds of agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Cooperation among automated agents is becoming increasingly important in various artificial intelligence applications. Coalitional (i.e., cooperative) game theory supplies conceptual and mathematical tools useful in the analysis of such interactions, and in particular in the achievement of stable outcomes among self-interested agents. Here, we study the minimal external subsidy required to stabilize the core of a coalitional game. Following the Cost of Stability (CoS) model introduced by Bachrach et al. [2009a], we give tight bounds on the required subsidy under various restrictions on the social structure of the game. We then compare the extended core induced by subsidies with the least core of the game, proving tight bounds on the ratio between the minimal subsidy and the minimal demand relaxation that each lead to stability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Humans have developed jurisprudence as a mechanism to solve conflictive situations by using past experiences. Following this principle, we propose an approach to enhance a multi-agent system by adding an authority which is able to generate new regulations whenever conflicts arise. Regulations are generated by learning from previous similar situations, using a machine learning technique (based on Case-Based Reasoning) that solves new problems using previous experiences. This approach requires: to be able to gather and evaluate experiences; and to be described in such a way that similar social situations require similar regulations. As a scenario to evaluate our proposal, we use a simplified version of a traffic scenario, where agents are traveling cars. Our goals are to avoid collisions between cars and to avoid heavy traffic. These situations, when happen, lead to the synthesis of new regulations. At each simulation step, applicable regulations are evaluated in terms of their effectiveness and necessity. Overtime the system generates a set of regulations that, if followed, improve system performance (i.e. goal achievement).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In agent-oriented programming and planning, agents' actions are typically specified in terms of postconditions, and the model of execution assumes that the environment carries the actions out exactly as specified. That is, it is assumed that the state of the environment after an action has been executed will satisfy its postcondition. In reality, however, such environments are rare: the actual execution of an action may fail, and the envisaged outcome is not met. We provide a conceptual framework for reasoning about success and failure of agents' behaviours. In particular, we propose a measure that reflects how "good" an environment is with respect to agent's capabilities and a given goal it might pursue. We also discuss which types of goals are worth pursuing, depending on the type of environment the agent is acting in.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Computational complexity of voting manipulation is one of the most actively studied topics in the area of computational social choice, starting with the groundbreaking work of [Bartholdi et al., 1989]. Most of the existing work in this area, including that of [Bartholdi et al., 1989], implicitly assumes that whenever several candidates receive the top score with respect to the given voting rule, the resulting tie is broken according to a lexicographic ordering over the candidates. However, till recently, an equally appealing method of tiebreaking, namely, selecting the winner uniformly at random among all tied candidates, has not been considered in the computational social choice literature. The first paper to analyze the complexity of voting manipulation under randomized tiebreaking is [Obraztsova et al., 2011], where the authors provide polynomial-time algorithms for this problem under scoring rules and—under an additional assumption on the manipulator’s utilities—for Maximin. In this paper, we extend the results of [Obraztsova et al., 2011] by showing that finding an optimal vote under randomized tie-breaking is computationally hard for Copeland and Maximin (with general utilities), as well as for STV and Ranked Pairs, but easy for the Bucklin rule and Plurality with Runoff.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs) are used to plan policies for multiple agents that must maximize a joint reward function but do not communicate with each other. The agents act under uncertainty about each other and the environment. This planning task arises in optimization of wireless networks, and other scenarios where communication between agents is restricted by costs or physical limits. DEC-POMDPs are a promising solution, but optimizing policies quickly becomes computationally intractable when problem size grows. Factored DEC-POMDPs allow large problems to be described in compact form, but have the same worst case complexity as non-factored DEC-POMDPs. We propose an efficient optimization algorithm for large factored infinite-horizon DEC-POMDPs. We formulate expectation-maximization based optimization into a new form, where complexity can be kept tractable by factored approximations. Our method performs well, and it can solve problems with more agents and larger state spaces than state of the art DEC-POMDP methods. We give results for factored infinite-horizon DEC-POMDP problems with up to 10 agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The design of multiagent simulations devoted to complex systems, addresses the issue of modeling behaviors that are involved at different space, time, behavior scales, each one being relevant so as to represent a feature of the phenomenon. We propose here a generic formalism intended to represent multiple environments, endowed with their own spatiotemporal scales and with behavioral rules for the agents they contain. An environment can be nested inside any agent, which itself is situated in one or more environments. This leads to a lattice decomposition of the global system, which appears to be necessary for an accurate design of multi-scale systems. This uniform representation of entities and behaviors at each abstraction level relies upon an interaction-oriented approach for the design of agent simulations, which clearly separates agents from interactions, from the modeling to the code. We also explain the implementation of our formalism within an existing interaction-based platform.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Coalition formation is a fundamental research topic in multi-agent systems. In this context, while it is desirable to generate a coalition structure that maximizes the sum of the values of the coalitions, the space of possible solutions is often too large to allow exhaustive search. Thus, a fundamental open question in this area is the following: Can we search through only a subset of coalition structures, and be guaranteed to find a solution that is within a desirable bound beta from optimum? If so, what is the minimum such subset? To date, the above question has only been partially answered by Sandholm et al. in their seminal work on anytime coalition structure generation Sandholm et al. (AIJ 1999). More specifically, they identified minimum subsets to be searched for two particular bounds: β = n and β = [n/2]. Nevertheless, the question remained open for other values of β. In this paper, we provide the complete answer to this question.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One approach for artificially intelligent agents wishing to maximise some performance metric in a given domain is to learn from a collection of training data that consists of actions or decisions made by some expert, in an attempt to imitate that expert's style. We refer to this type of agent as an expert imitator. In this paper we investigate whether performance can be improved by combining decisions from multiple expert imitators. In particular, we investigate two existing approaches for combining decisions. The first approach combines decisions by employing ensemble voting between multiple expert imitators. The second approach dynamically selects the best imitator to use at runtime given the performance of the imitators in the current environment. We investigate these approaches in the domain of computer poker. In particular, we create expert imitators for limit and no limit Texas Hold'em and determine whether their performance can be improved by combining their decisions using the two approaches listed above.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
It is well known that cheating occurs in sports. In cup competitions, a common type of sports competition, one method of cheating is in manipulating the seeding to unfairly advantage a particular team. Previous empirical and theoretical studies of seeding manipulation have focused on competitions with unrestricted seeding. However, real cup competitions often place restrictions on seedings to ensure fairness, wide geographic interest, and so on. In this paper, we perform an extensive empirical study of seeding manipulation under comprehensive and realistic sets of restrictions. A generalized random model of competition problems is proposed. This model creates a realistic range of problem instances that are used to identify the sets of seeding restrictions that are hard to manipulate in practice. We end with a discussion of the implications of this work and recommendations for organizing competitions so as to prevent or reduce the opportunities for manipulating the seeding.</p>

Consider the following problem in game manipulation. A tournament designer who has full knowledge of the match outcomes between any possible pair of players would like to create a bracket for a balanced single-elimination tournament so that their favorite player will win.Although this problem has been studied in the areas of voting and tournament manipulation, it is still unknown whether it can be solved in polynomial time.We focus on identifying several general cases for which the tournament can always be rigged efficiently so that the given player wins. We give constructive proofs that, under some natural assumptions, if a player is ranked among the top K players, then one can efficiently rig the tournament for thegiven player, even when K is as large as 19% of the players.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Real-time agent-centric algorithms have been used for learning and solving problems since the introduction of the LRTA<em> algorithm in 1990. In this time period, numerous variants have been produced, however, they have generally followed the same approach in varying parameters to learn a heuristic which estimates the remaining cost to arrive at a goal state. Recently, a different approach, RIBS, was suggested which, instead of learning costs to the goal, learns costs from the start state. RIBS can solve some problems faster, but in other problems has poor performance. We present a new algorithm, f-cost Learning Real-Time A</em> (f-LRTA<em>), which combines both approaches, simultaneously learning distances from the start and heuristics to the goal. An empirical evaluation demonstrates that f-LRTA</em> outperforms both RIBS and LRTA*-style approaches in a range of scenarios.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We investigate the emergence and stability of social conventions for efficiently resolving conflicts through reinforcement learning. Facilitation of coordination and conflict resolution is an important issue in multi-agent systems. However, exhibiting coordinated and negotiation activities is computationally expensive. In this paper, we first describe a conflict situation using a Markov game which is iterated if the agents fail to resolve their conflicts, where the repeated failures result in an inefficient society. Using this game, we show that social conventions for resolving conflicts emerge, but their stability and social efficiency depend on the payoff matrices that characterize the agents. We also examine how unbalanced populations and small heterogeneous agents affect efficiency and stability of the resulting conventions. Our results show that (a) a type of indecisive agent that is generous for adverse results leads to unstable societies, and (b) selfish agents that have an explicit order of benefits make societies stable and efficient.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The VCG mechanism is the gold standard for combinatorial auctions (CAs), and it maximizes social welfare. In contrast, the revenue-maximizing (aka optimal) CA is unknown, and designing one is NP-hard. Therefore, research on optimal CAs has progressed into special settings. Notably, Levin [1997] derived the optimal CA for complements when each agent's private type is one-dimensional. We introduce a new research avenue for increasing revenue where we poke holes in the allocation space — based on the bids — and then use a welfare-maximizing allocation rule within the remaining allocation set. In this paper, the first step down this avenue, we introduce a new form of "reserve pricing" into CAs. We show that Levin's optimal revenue can be 2-approximated by using "monopoly reserve prices" to curtail the allocation set, followed by welfare-maximizing allocation and Levin's payment rule. A key lemma of potential independent interest is that the expected revenue from any truthful allocation-monotonic mechanism equals the expected virtual valuation; this generalizes Myerson's lemma [1981] from the single-parameter environment. Our mechanism is close to the gold standard and thus easier to adopt than Levin's. It also requires less information about the prior over the bidders' types, and is always more efficient. Finally, we show that the optimal revenue can be 6-approximated even if the "reserve pricing" is required to be symmetric across bidders.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Envy-freeness is a well-known fairness concept for analyzing mechanisms. Its traditional definition requires that no individual envies another individual. However, an individual (or a group of agents) may envy another group, even if she (or they) does not envy another individual. In mechanisms with monetary transfer, such as combinatorial auctions, considering such fairness requirements, which are refinements of traditional envy-freeness, is meaningful and brings up a new interesting research direction in mechanism design. In this paper, we introduce two new concepts of fairness called envy-freeness of an individual toward a group, and envy-freeness of a group toward a group. They are natural extensions of traditional envy-freeness. We discuss combinatorial auction mechanisms that satisfy these concepts. First, we characterize such mechanisms by focusing on their allocation rules. Then we clarify the connections between these concepts and three other properties: the core, strategy-proofness, and false-name-proofness.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in AI and multi-agent systems (MAS). Thus, coalitional games, including Coalition Structure Generation (CSG), have been attracting considerable attention from the AI research community. Traditionally, the input of a coalitional game is a black-box function called a characteristic function. A range of previous studies have found that many problems in coalitional games tend to be computationally intractable when the input is a black-box function. Recently, several concise representation schemes for a characteristic function have been proposed. Although these schemes are effective for reducing the representation size, most problems remain computationally intractable. In this paper, we develop a new concise representation scheme based on the idea of agent types. Intuitively, a type represents a set of agents, which are recognized as having the same contribution. This representation can be exponentially more concise than existing concise representation schemes. Furthermore, this idea can be used in conjunction with existing schemes to further reduce the representation size. Moreover, we show that most of the problems in coalitional games, including CSG, can be solved in polynomial time in the number of agents, assuming the number of possible types is fixed.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Typical solutions for agents assessing trust relies on the circulation of information on the individual level, i.e. reputational images, subjective experi- ences, statistical analysis, etc. This work presents an alternative approach, inspired to the cognitive heuristics enabling humans to reason at a categorial level. The approach is envisaged as a crucial ability for agents in order to: (1) estimate trustworthiness of unknown trustees based on an ascribed mem- bership to categories; (2) learn a series of emer- gent relations between trustees observable proper- ties and their effective abilities to fulfill tasks in sit- uated conditions. On such a basis, categorization is provided to recognize signs (Manifesta) through which hidden capabilities (Kripta) can be inferred. Learning is provided to refine reasoning attitudes needed to ascribe tasks to categories. A series of ar- chitectures combining categorization abilities, indi- vidual experiences and context awareness are eval- uated and compared in simulated experiments.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As explained by Axelrod in his seminal work An Evolutionary Approach to Norms, punishment is a key mechanism to achieve the necessary social control and to impose social norms in a self-regulated society. In this paper, we distinguish between two enforcing mechanisms. i.e. punishment and sanction, focusing on the specific ways in which they favor the emergence and maintenance of cooperation. The key research question is to find more stable and cheaper mechanisms for norm compliance in hybrid social environments (populated by humans and computational agents). To achieve this task, we have developed a normative agent able to punish and sanction defectors and to dynamically choose the right amount of punishment and sanction to impose on them (Dynamic Adaptation Heuristic). The results obtained through agent-based simulation show us that sanction is more effective and less costly than punishment in the achievement and maintenance of cooperation and it makes the population more resilient to sudden changes than if it were enforced only by mere punishment.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present the notion of Social Instruments as mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of conventions from repeated interactions between members of a society. Specifically, we focus on two social instruments: rewiring and observation. Our main goal is to provide agents with tools that allow them to leverage their social network of interactions when effectively addressing coordination and learning problems, paying special attention to dissolving meta-stable subconventions. Initial experiments throw some light on how Self-Reinforcing Substructures (SRS) in the network prevent full convergence, resulting in reduced convergence rates. The use of an effective composed social instrument (observation + rewiring) allow agents to eliminate the subconventions that otherwise remained meta-stable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Agent systems based on the BDI paradigm need to make decisions about which plans are used to achieve their goals. Usually the choice of which plans to use to achieve a particular goal is left up to the system to determine. In this paper we show how preferences, which can be set by the user of the system, can be incorporated into the BDI execution process and used to guide the choices made.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In multi-issue automated negotiation against unknown opponents, a key part of effective negotiation is the choice of concession strategy. In this paper, we develop a principled concession strategy, based on Gaussian processes predicting the opponent's future behaviour. We then use this to set the agent's concession rate dynamically during a single negotiation session. We analyse the performance of our strategy and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art negotiating agents from the 2010 Automated Negotiating Agents Competition, in both a tournament setting and in self-play, across a variety of negotiation domains.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a novel online planning algorithm for ad hoc team settings — challenging situations in which an agent must collaborate with unknown teammates without prior coordination. Our approach is based on constructing and solving a series of stage games, and then using biased adaptive play to choose actions. The utility function in each stage game is estimated via Monte-Carlo tree search using the UCT algorithm. We establish analytically the convergence of the algorithm and show that it performs well in a variety of ad hoc team domains.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many of the possible applications as well as the theoretical models of computational social choice,the agents’ preferences are represented as partialorders. In this paper, we extend the maximum likelihood approach for defining “optimal” voting rules to this setting. We consider distributions in which the pairwise comparisons / incomparabilities between alternatives are drawn i.i.d. We call suchmodels pairwise-independentmodels and show that they correspond to a class of voting rules that we call pairwise scoring rules. This generalizes rulessuch as Kemeny and Borda. Moreover, we show that Borda is the only pairwise scoring rule that satisfies neutrality, when the outcome space is the set of all alternatives. We then study which voting rules defined for linear orders can be extended to partial orders via our MLE model. We show that any weakly neutral outcome scoring rule (includingany ranking/candidate scoring rule) based onthe weighted majority graph can be represented as the MLE of a weakly neutral pairwise-independent model. Therefore, all such rules admit natural extensionsto profiles of partial orders. Finally, we propose a specific MLE model πk for generating a set of k winning alternatives, and study the computational complexity of winner determination for the MLE of πk.</p>

Computing the market maker price of a security in a combinatorial prediction market is #P-hard. We devise a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) that computes the price of any security in disjunctive normal form (DNF) within an ε multiplicative error factor in time polynomial in 1ε and the size of the input, with high probability and under reasonable assumptions. Our algorithm is a Monte-Carlo technique based on importance sampling. The algorithm can also approximately price securities represented in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with additive error bounds. To illustrate the applicability of our algorithm, we show that many securities in Yahoo!'s popular combinatorial prediction market game called Predictalot can be represented by DNF formulas of polynomial size.</p>

Recent real-world deployments of Stackelberg security games make it critical that we address human adversaries' bounded rationality in computing optimal strategies. To that end, this paper provides three key contributions: (i) new efficient algorithms for computing optimal strategic solutions using Prospect Theory and Quantal Response Equilibrium; (ii) the most comprehensive experiment to date studying the effectiveness of different models against human subjects for security games; and (iii) new techniques for generating representative payoff structures for behavioral experiments in generic classes of games. Our results with human subjects show that our new techniques outperform the leading contender for modeling human behavior in security games.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Continuous state DEC-MDPs are critical for agent teams in domains involving resources such as time, but scaling them up is a significant challenge. To meet this challenge, we first introduce a novel continuous-time DEC-MDP model that exploits transition independence in domains with temporal constraints. Moreimportantly, we present a new locally optimal algorithm called SPAC. Compared to the best previous algorithm, SPAC finds solutions of comparable quality substantially faster; SPAC also scales to larger teams of agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper examines an extended double auction model where market clearing is restricted by temporal constraints. It is found that the allocation problem in this model can be effectively transformed into a weighted bipartite matching in graph theory. By using the augmentation technique, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in this model and demonstrate the advantages of the payment compared with the classical VCG payment (the Clarke pivot payment). We also show that the algorithms for both allocation and payment calculation run in polynomial time. It is expected that the method and results provided in this paper can be applied to the design and analysis of dynamic double auctions and futures markets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study distributed task-allocation problems wherecooperative agents need to perform some tasks simultaneously. Examples are multi-agent routing problems where several agents need to visit some targets simultaneously, for example, to move obstacles out of the way cooperatively. In this paper, we first generalize the concept of reaction functions proposed in the literature to characterize the agent costs of performing multiple complex tasks. Second, we show how agents can construct and approximate reaction functions in a distributed way. Third, we show how reaction functions can be used by an auction-like algorithm to allocate tasks to agents. Finally, we show empirically that the team costs of our algorithms are substantially smaller than those of an existing state-of-the-art allocation algorithm for complex tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR) seeks to identify the dynamic team structures and team behaviors from the observed activity sequences (team traces) of a set of intelligent agents, based on a library of known team activity sequences (team plans). Previous MAPR systems require that team traces and team plans are fully observed. In this paper we relax this constraint, i.e., team traces and team plans are allowed to be partial. This is an important task in applying MAPR to real-world domains, since in many applications it is often difficult to collect full team traces or team plans due to environment limitations, e.g., military operation. This is also a hard problem since the information available is limited. We propose a novel approach to recognizing team plans from partial team traces and team plans. We encode the MAPR problem as a satisfaction problem and solve the problem using a state-of-the-art weighted MAX-SAT solver. We empirically show that our algorithm is both effective and efficient.</p>

Shapley Value as a Function of the Quota in Weighted Voting Games / 490
Yair Zick, Alexander Skopalik, Edith Elkind
In weighted voting games, each agent has a weight, and a coalition of players is deemed to be winning if its weight meets or exceeds the given quota. An agent's power in such games is usually measured by her Shapley value, which depends both on the agent's weight and the quota. [Zuckerman et. al., 2008] show that one can alter a player's power significantly by modifying the quota, and investigate some of the related algorithmic issues. In this paper, we answer a number of questions that were left open by [Zuckerman et. al., 2008]: we show that, even though deciding whether a quota maximizes or minimizes an agent's Shapley value is coNP-hard, finding a Shapley value-maximizing quota is easy. Minimizing a player's power appears to be more difficult. However, we propose and evaluate a heuristic for this problem, which takes into account the voter's rank and the overall weight distribution. We also explore a number of other algorithmic issues related to quota manipulation.</p>

The Partner Units Problem is a specific type of configuration problem with important applications in the area of surveillance and security. In this work we show that a special case of the problem, that is of great interest to our partners in industry, can directly be tackled via a structural problem decompostion method. Combining these theoretical insights with general purpose AI techniques such as constraint satisfaction and SAT solving proves to be particularly effective in practice.</p>

We also give an intricate proof of probabilistically approximate completeness for D-CRSat, highlighting key features of the method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many fundamental problems in artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and verification involve reasoning about sets and relations between sets and can be modeled as set constraint satisfaction problems (set CSPs). Such problems are frequently intractable, but there are several important set CSPs that are known to be polynomial-time tractable. We introduce a large class of set CSPs that can be solved in quadratic time. Our class, which we call EI, contains all previously known tractable set CSPs, but also some new ones that are of crucial importance for example in description logics. The class of EI set constraints has an elegant universal-algebraic characterization, which we use to show that every set constraint language that properly contains all EI set constraints already has a finite sublanguage with an NP-hard constraint satisfaction problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Lazy clause generation is a powerful approach to reducing search in constraint programming. This is achieved by recording sets of domain restrictions that previously led to failure as new clausal propagators. Symmetry breaking approaches are also powerful methods for reducing search by recog- nizing that parts of the search tree are symmetric and do not need to be explored. In this paper we show how we can successfully combine symmetry breaking methods with lazy clause generation. Further, we show that the more precise nogoods generated by a lazy clause solver allow our combined approach to exploit redundancies that cannot be exploited via any previous symmetry breaking method, be it static or dynamic.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We examine the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems that consist of a set of AllDiff constraints. Such CSPs naturally model a wide range of real-world and combinatorial problems, like scheduling, frequency allocations and graph coloring problems. As this problem is known to be NP-complete, we investigate under which further assumptions it becomes tractable. We observe that a crucial property seems to be the convexity of the variable domains and constraints. Our main contribution is an extensive study of the complexity of Multiple AllDiff CSPs for a set of natural parameters, like maximum domain size and maximum size of the constraint scopes. We show that, depending on the parameter, convexity can make the problem tractable while it is provably intractable in general.</p>

In this paper, we study algorithms for probabilistic satisfiability (PSAT), an NP-complete problem, and their empiric complexity distribution. We define a PSAT normal form, based on which we propose two logic-based algorithms: a reduction of normal form PSAT instances to SAT, and a linear-algebraic algorithm with a logic-based column generation strategy. We conclude that both algorithms present a phase transition behaviour and that the latter has a much better performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Transposition tables are a powerful tool in search domains for avoiding duplicate effort and for guiding node expansions. Traditionally, however, they have only been applicable when the current state is exactly the same as a previously explored state. We consider a generalized transposition table, whereby a similarity metric that exploits local structure is used to compare the current state with a neighbourhood of previously seen states. We illustrate this concept and forward pruning based on function approximation in the domain of Skat, and show that we can achieve speedups of 16+ over standard methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Bessiere et al. (AAAI'08) showed that several intractable global constraints can be efficiently propagated when certain natural problem parameters are small. In particular, the complete propagation of a global constraint is fixed-parameter tractable in k — the number of holes in domains — whenever bound consistency can be enforced in polynomial time; this applies to the global constraints AtMost-NValue and Extended Global Cardinality (EGC). In this paper we extend this line of research and introduce the concept of reduction to a problem kernel, a key concept of parameterized complexity, to the field of global constraints. In particular, we show that the consistency problem for AtMost-NValue constraints admits a linear time reduction to an equivalent instance on O(k2) variables and domain values. This small kernel can be used to speed up the complete propagation of NValue constraints. We contrast this result by showing that the consistency problem for EGC constraints does not admit a reduction to a polynomial problem kernel unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many important problems can be compactly represented as quantified boolean formulas (QBF) and solved by general QBF solvers. To date QBF solvers have mainly focused on determining whether or not the input QBF is true or false. However, additional important information about an application can be gathered from its QBF formulation. In this paper we demonstrate that a circuit-based QBF solver can be exploited to obtain a Q-Resolution proof of the truth or the falsity of a QBF. QBFs have a natural interpretation as a two person game and our main result is to show how, via a simple computation, the moves for the winning player can be computed directly from these proofs. This result shows that the proof is a representation of the winning strategy. In previous approaches the winning strategy has often been represented in a way that makes it hard to verify. In our approach the correctness of the strategy follows directly from the correctness of the proof, which is relatively easy to verify.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT are two optimal DCOP search algorithms that are similar except for their search strategies: the former uses best-first search and the latter uses depth-first branch-and-bound search. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called ADOPT(k), that generalizes them. Its behavior depends on the k parameter. It behaves like ADOPT when k = 1, like BnB-ADOPT when k = ∞ and like a hybrid of ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT when 1 &lt; k &lt; ∞. We prove that ADOPT(k) is a correct and complete algorithm and experimentally show that ADOPT(k) outperforms ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT on several benchmarks across several metrics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address a dynamic decision problem in which decision makers must pay some costs when they change their decisions along the way. We formalize this problem as Dynamic SAT (DynSAT) with decision change costs, whose goal is to find a sequence of models that minimize the aggregation of the costs for changing variables. We provide two solutions to solve a specific case of this problem. The first uses a Weighted Partial MaxSAT solver after we encode the entire problem as a WeightedPartial MaxSAT problem. The second solution, which we believe is novel, uses the Lagrangian decomposition technique that divides the entire problem into sub-problems, each of which can be separately solved by an exact Weighted Partial MaxSATsolver, and produces both lower and upper bounds on the optimal in an anytime manner. To compare the performance of these solvers, we experimentedon the random problem and the target trackingproblem. The experimental results show that a solver based on Lagrangian decomposition performs better for the random problem and competitively for the target tracking problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The minimization problem for propositional formulas is an important optimization problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. In general, the problem is Sigma-2-complete under Turing reductions, but restricted versions are tractable. We study the complexity of minimization for formulas in two established frameworks for restricted propositional logic: The Post framework allowing arbitrarily nested formulas over a set of Boolean connectors, and the constraint setting, allowing generalizations of CNF formulas. In the Post case, we obtain a dichotomy result: Minimization is solvable in polynomial time or coNP-hard. This result also applies to Boolean circuits. For CNF formulas, we obtain new minimization algorithms for a large class of formulas, and give strong evidence that we have covered all polynomial-time cases.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper proposes the integration of the resolution rule for Max-SAT with unsatisfiability-based Max-SAT solvers. First, we show that the resolution rule for Max-SAT can be safely applied as dictated by the resolution proof associated with an unsatisfiable core when such proof is read-once, that is, each clause is used at most once in the resolution process. Second, we study how this property can be integrated in an unsatisfiability-based solver. In particular, the resolution rule for Max-SAT is applied to read-once proofs or to read-once subparts of a general proof. Finally, we perform an empirical investigation on structured instances from recent Max-SAT evaluations. Preliminary results show that the use of read-once resolution substantially improves the performance of the solver.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Heuristics used for solving hard real-time search problems have regions with depressions. Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the heuristic function is exceedingly low compared to the actual cost to reach a solution. Real-time search algorithms easily become trapped in those regions since the heuristic values of states in them may need to be updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art real-time search algorithms like LSS-LRTA<em>, LRTA</em>(k), etc., improve LRTA<em>'s mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding or escaping depressed regions. This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a heuristic depression. We apply the principle to LSS-LRTA</em> producing aLSS-LRTA<em>, a new real-time search algorithm whose search is guided towards exiting regions with heuristic depressions. We show our algorithm outperforms LSS-LRTA</em> in standard real-time benchmarks. In addition we prove aLSS-LRTA<em> has most of the good theoretical properties of LSS-LRTA</em>.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Hash Distributed A<em> (HDA</em>) is a parallel A<em> algorithm that is proven to be effective in optimal sequential planning with unit edge costs. HDA</em> leverages the Zobrist function to almost uniformly distribute and schedule work among processors. This paper evaluates the performance of HDA<em> in optimal sequence alignment. We observe that with a large number of CPU cores HDA</em> suffers from an increase of search overhead caused by reexpansions of states in the closed list due to nonuniform edge costs in this domain. We therefore present a new work distribution strategy limiting processors to distribute work, thus increasing the possibility of detecting such duplicate search effort. We evaluate the performance of this approach on a cluster of multi-core machines and show that the approach scales well up to 384 CPU cores.</p>

The number partitioning problem is to divide a given set of N positive integers into K subsets, so that the sum of the numbers in each subset are as nearly equal as possible. While effective algorithms for two-way partitioning exist, multi-way partitioning is much more challenging. We introduce an improved algorithm for optimal multi-way partitioning, by combining several existing algorithms with some new extensions. We test our algorithm for partitioning 31-bit integers from three to ten ways, and demonstrate orders of magnitude speedup over the previous state of the art.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are commonly defined on finite domains. In real life, constrained variables can evolve over time. A variable can actually take an infinite sequence of values over discrete time points. In this paper, we propose constraint programming on infinite data streams, which provides a natural way to model constrained time-varying problems. In our framework, variable domains are specified by ω-regular languages. We introduce special stream operators as basis to form stream expressions and constraints. Stream CSPs have infinite search space. We propose a search procedure that can recognize and avoid infinite search over duplicate search space. The solution set of a stream CSP can be represented by a Büchi automaton allowing stream values to be non-periodic. Consistency notions are defined to reduce the search space early. We illustrate the feasibility of the framework by examples and experiments.</p>

We define solving techniques for the Minimum Satisfiability Problem (MinSAT), propose an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the Weighted Partial MinSAT problem, and report on an empirical evaluation of the algorithm on Min-3SAT, MaxClique, and combinatorial auction problems. Techniques solving MinSAT are substantially different from those for the Maximum Satisfiability Problem (MaxSAT). Our results provide empirical evidence that solving combinatorial optimization problems by reducing them to MinSAT may be substantially faster than reducing them to MaxSAT, and even competitive with specific algorithms. We also use MinSAT to study an interesting correlation between the minimum number and the maximum number of satisfied clauses of a SAT instance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consider random hypergraphs on n vertices, where each k-element subset of vertices is selected with probability p independently and randomly as a hyperedge. By sparse we mean that the total number of hyperedges is O(n) or O(n ln n). When k = 2, these are exactly the classical Erdös-Rényi random graphs G(n,p). We prove that with high probability, hinge width on these sparse random hypergraphs can grow linearly with the expected number of hyperedges. Some random constraint satisfaction problems such as Model RB and Model RD have satisfiability thresholds on these sparse constraint hypergraphs, thus the large hinge width results provide some theoretical evidence for random instances around satisfiability thresholds to be hard for a standard hinge-decomposition based algorithm. We also conduct experiments on these and other kinds of random graphs with several hundreds vertices, including regular random graphs and power law random graphs. The experimental results also show that hinge width can grow linearly with the number of edges on these different random graphs. These results may be of further interests.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As adversarial environments become more complex, it is increasingly crucial for agents to exploit the mistakes of weaker opponents, particularly in the context of winning tournaments and competitions.In this work, we present a simple post processing technique, which wecall Perfect Information Post-Mortem Analysis (PIPMA), that can quickly assess the playing strength of an opponent in certain classes of game environments. We apply this technique to skat, a popular German card game, and show that we can achieve substantial performance gains against not only players weaker than our program, but against stronger players as well. Most importantly, PIPMA can model the opponent after only a handful of games. To our knowledge, this makes our work the first successful example of an opponent modelling technique that can adapt its play to a particular opponent in real time in a complex game setting.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms (such as those for the element constraint) frequently make implicit use of short supports — by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support for all other variables and values and save substantial work. However, to date general purpose propagation algorithms (such as GAC-Schema) rely upon supports involving all variables. We demonstrate how to employ short supports in a new general purpose propagation algorithm called ShortGAC. This works when provided with either an explicit list of allowed short tuples, or a function to calculate the next supporting short tuple. Empirical analyses demonstrate the efficiency of ShortGAC compared to other general-purpose propagation algorithms. In some cases ShortGAC even exhibits similar performance to special-purpose propagators.</p>

Experiments show that this new constraint offers a much stronger filtering than an edge-finder and that it allows to solve larger instances of the runway scheduling problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many systems use Markov models to generate finite-length sequences that imitate a given style. These systems often need to enforce specific control constraints on the sequences to generate. Unfortunately, control constraints are not compatible with Markov models, as they induce long-range dependencies that violate the Markov hypothesis of limited memory. Attempts to solve this issue using heuristic search do not give any guarantee on the nature and probability of the sequences generated. We propose a novel and efficient approach to controlled Markov generation for a specific class of control constraints that 1) guarantees that generated sequences satisfy control constraints and 2) follow the statistical distribution of the initial Markov model. Revisiting Markov generation in the framework of constraint satisfaction, we show how constraints can be compiled into a non-homogeneous Markov model, using arc-consistency techniques and renormalization. We illustrate the approach on a melody generation problem and sketch some realtime applications in which control constraints are given by gesture controllers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) methods have had recent success in games, planning, and optimization. MCTS uses results from rollouts to guide search; a rollout is a path that descends the tree with a randomized decision at each ply until reaching a leaf. MCTS results can be strongly influenced by the choice of appropriate policy to bias the rollouts. Most previous work on MCTS uses static uniform random or domain-specific policies. We describe a new MCTS method that dynamically adapts the rollout policy during search, in deterministic optimization problems. Our starting point is Cazenave's original Nested Monte Carlo Search (NMCS), but rather than navigating the tree directly we instead use gradient ascent on the rollout policy at each level of the nested search. We benchmark this new Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm and examine its behavior. Our test problems are instances of Crossword Puzzle Construction and Morpion Solitaire. Over moderate time scales NRPA can substantially improve search efficiency compared to NMCS, and over longer time scales NRPA improves upon all previous published solutions for the test problems. Results include a new Morpion Solitaire solution that improves upon the previous human-generated record that had stood for over 30 years.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We develop a real-time algorithm based on a Monte-Carlo game tree search for solving a quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP), which is a CSP where some variables are universally quantified. A universally quantified variable represents a choice of nature or an adversary. The goal of a QCSP is to make a robust plan against an adversary. However, obtaining a complete plan off-line is intractable when the size of the problem becomes large. Thus, we need to develop a real-time algorithm that sequentially selects a promising value at each deadline. Such a problem has been considered in the field of game tree search. In a standard game tree search algorithm, developing a good static evaluation function is crucial. However, developing a good static evaluation function for a QCSP is very difficult since it must estimate the possibility that a partially assigned QCSP is solvable. Thus, we apply a Monte-Carlo game tree search technique called UCT. However, the simple application of the UCT algorithm does not work since the player and the adversary are asymmetric, i.e., finding a game sequence where the player wins is very rare. We overcome this difficulty by introducing constraint propagation techniques. We experimentally compare the winning probability of our UCT-based algorithm and the state-of-the-art alpha-beta search algorithm. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in large-scale problems.</p>

We present a novel formalization for this problem which includes a search tree called the increasing cost tree (ICT) and a corresponding search algorithm that finds optimal solutions. We analyze this new formalization and compare it to the previous state-of-the-art A</em>-based approach. Experimental results on various domains show the benefits and drawbacks of this approach. A speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude was obtained in a number of cases.</p>

Problems that require multiple agents to follow non-interfering paths from their current states to their respective goal states are called cooperative pathfinding problems. We present the first {complete algorithm for finding these paths that is sufficiently fast for real-time applications. Furthermore, our algorithm offers a trade-off between running time and solution quality. We then refine our algorithm into an anytime algorithm that first quickly finds a solution, and then uses any remaining time to incrementally improve that solution until it is optimal or the algorithm is terminated. We compare our algorithms to those in the literature and show that in addition to completeness, our algorithms offer improved solution quality as well as competitive running time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Bounded suboptimal search algorithms offer shorter solving times bysacrificing optimality and instead guaranteeing solution costs withina desired factor of optimal. Typically these algorithms use a singleadmissible heuristic both for guiding search and bounding solutioncost. In this paper, we present a new approach to bounded suboptimalsearch, Explicit Estimation Search, that separates these roles,consulting potentially inadmissible information to determine searchorder and using admissible information to guarantee the cost bound.Unlike previous proposals, it successfully combines estimates ofsolution length and solution cost to predict which node will lead mostquickly to a solution within the suboptimality bound. An empiricalevaluation across six diverse benchmark domains shows that ExplicitEstimation Search is competitive with the previous state of the art indomains with unit-cost actions and substantially outperformspreviously proposed techniques for domains in which solution cost andlength can differ.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Heuristics are crucial tools in decreasing search effort in varied fields of AI. In order to be effective, a heuristic must be efficient to compute, as well as provide useful information to the search algorithm. However, some well-known heuristics which do well in reducing backtracking are so heavy that the gain of deploying them in a search algorithm might be outweighed by their overhead. We propose a rational metareasoning approach to decide when to deploy heuristics, using CSP backtracking search as a case study. In particular, a value of information approach is taken to adaptive deployment of solution-count estimation heuristics for value ordering. Empirical results show that indeed the proposed mechanism successfully balances the tradeoff between decreasing backtracking and heuristic computational overhead, resulting in a significant overall search time reduction.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper considers matrix models, a class of CSPs which generally exhibit significant symmetries. It proposed the idea of LexLeader feasibility checkers that verify, during search, whether the current partial assignment can be extended into a canonical solution. The feasibility checkers are based on a novel result by [Katsirelos et al., 2010] on how to check efficiently whether a solution is canonical. The paper generalizes this result to partial assignments, various variable orderings, and value symmetries. Empirical results on 5 standard benchmarks shows that feasibility checkers may bring significant performance gains, when jointly used with DoubleLex or SnakeLex.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Balanced multi-way number partitioning (BMNP) seeks to split a collection of numbers into subsets with (roughly) the same cardinality and subset sum. The problem is NP-hard, and there are several exact and approximate algorithms for it. However, existing exact algorithms solve only the simpler, balanced two-way number partitioning variant, whereas the most effective approximate algorithm, BLDM, may produce widely varying subset sums. In this paper, we introduce the LRM algorithm that lowers the expected spread in subset sums to one third that of BLDM for uniformly distributed numbers and odd subset cardinalities. We also propose Meld, a novel strategy for skewed number distributions. A combination of LRM and Meld leads to a heuristic technique that consistently achieves a narrower spread of subset sums than BLDM.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One of main difficulties of multi-dimensional packing problems is the fragmentation of free space into several unusable small parts after a few items are packed. This study proposes a defragmentation technique to combine the fragmented space into a continuous usable space, which potentially allows the packing of additional items. We illustrate the effectiveness of this technique on the two- and three-dimensional Bin Packing Problems. In conjunction with a bin shuffling strategy for incremental improvement, our resultant algorithm outperforms all leading meta-heuristic approaches.</p>

Many AI applications are based on some underlying logic that tolerates inconsistent information in a non-trivial way. However, it is not always clear what should be the exact nature of such a logic, and how to choose one for a specific application. In this paper, we formulate a list of desirable properties of `ideal' logics for reasoning with inconsistency, identify a variety of logics that have these properties, and provide a systematic way of constructing, for every n &gt; 2, a family of such n-valued logics.</p>

We establish complexities of the conjunctive query entailment problem for classes of existential rules (i.e. Tuple-Generating Dependencies or Datalog+/- rules). Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce the class of greedy bounded treewidth sets (gbts), which covers guarded rules, and their known generalizations, namely (weakly) frontier-guarded rules. We provide a generic algorithm for query entailment with gbts, which is worst-case optimal for combined complexity with bounded predicate arity, as well as for data complexity. Second, we classify several gbts classes, whose complexity was unknown, namely frontier-one, frontier-guarded and weakly frontier-guarded rules, with respect to combined complexity (with bounded and unbounded predicate arity) and data complexity.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A major challenge of query language design is the combination of expressivity with effective static analyses such as query containment. In the setting of XML, documents are seen as finite trees, whose structure may additionally be constrained by type constraints such as those described by an XML schema. We consider the problem of query containment in the presence of type constraints for a class of regular path queries extended with counting and interleaving operators. The counting operator restricts the number of occurrences of children nodes satisfying a given logical property. The interleaving operator provides a succinct notation for describing the absence of order between nodes satisfying a logical property. We provide a logic-based framework supporting these operators, which can be used to solve common query reasoning problems such as satisfiability and containment of queries in exponential time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We provide reformulations and generalizations of both the semantics of logic programs by Faber, Leone and Pfeifer and its extension to arbitrary propositional formulas by Truszczynski. Unlike the previous definitions, our generalizations refer neither to grounding nor to fixpoints, and apply to first-order formulas containing aggregate expressions. In the same spirit as the first-order stable model semantics proposed by Ferraris, Lee and Lifschitz, the semantics proposed here are based on syntactic transformations that are similar to circumscription. The reformulations provide useful insights into the FLP semantics and its relationship to circumscription and the first-order stable model semantics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In Model-Based Diagnosis, a diagnostic algorithm is typically used to compute diagnoses using a model of a real-world system and some observations. Contrary to classical hypothesis, in real-world applications it is sometimes the case that either the model, the observations or the diagnostic algorithm are abnormal with respect to some required properties; with possibly huge economical consequences. Determining which abnormalities exist constitutes a meta-diagnostic problem. We contribute, first, with a general theory of meta-diagnosis with clear semantics to handle this problem. Second, we propose a series of typically required properties and relate them between themselves. Finally, using our meta-diagnostic framework and the studied properties and relations, we model and solve some common meta-diagnostic problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In a seminal paper, Lin and Reiter introduced the notion of progression of basic action theories. Unfortunately, progression is second-order in general. Recently, Liu and Lakemeyer improve on earlier results and show that for the local-effect and normal actions case, progression is computable but may lead to an exponential blow-up. Nevertheless, they show that for certain kinds of expressive first-order knowledge bases with disjunctive information, called proper+, it is efficient. However, answering queries about the resulting state is still undecidable. In this paper, we continue this line of research and extend proper+ to include functions. We prove that their progression wrt local-effect, normal actions, and range-restricted theories, is first-order definable and efficiently computable. We then provide a new logically sound and complete decision procedure for certain kinds of queries.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Possibilistic logic is a well-known framework for dealing with uncertainty and reasoning under inconsistent knowledge bases. Standard possibilistic logic expressions are propositional logic formulas associated with positive real degrees belonging to [0,1]. However, in practice it may be difficult for an expert to provide exact degrees associated with formulas of a knowledge base. This paper proposes a flexible representation of uncertain information where the weights associated with formulas are in the form of intervals. We first study a framework for reasoning with interval-based possibilistic knowledge bases by extending main concepts of possibilistic logic such as the ones of necessity and possibility measures. We then provide a characterization of an interval-based possibilistic logic base by means of a concept of compatible standard possibilistic logic bases. We show that interval-based possibilistic logic extends possibilistic logic in the case where all intervals are singletons. Lastly, we provide computational complexity results of deriving plausible conclusions from interval-based possibilistic bases and we show that the flexibility in representing uncertain information is handled without extra computational costs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Uncertainty is unavoidable when modeling most application domains. In medicine, for example, symptoms (such as pain, dizziness, or nausea) are always subjective, and hence imprecise and incomparable. Additionally, concepts and their relationships may be inexpressible in a crisp, clear-cut manner. We extend the description logic ALC with multi-valued semantics based on lattices that can handle uncertainty on concepts as well as on the axioms of the ontology. We introduce reasoning methods for this logic w.r.t. general concept inclusions and show that the complexity of reasoning is not increased by this new semantics.</p>

It is well-known that satisfiability (and hence validity) in the minimal classical modal logic is a PSPACE-complete problem. In this paper we consider the satisfiability and validity problems (here they are not dual, although mutually reducible) for the minimal modal logic over a finite Lukasiewicz chain, and show that they also are PSPACE-complete. This result is also true when adding either the Delta operator or truth constants in the language, i.e. in all these cases it is PSPACE-complete.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One criticism often advanced against abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs), is that these consider only one form of interaction between atomic arguments: specifically that an argument attacks another. Attempts to broaden the class of relationships include bipolar frameworks, where arguments support others, and abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs). The latter, allow "acceptance'' of an argument, x, to be predicated on a given propositional function, C_x, dependent on the corresponding acceptance of its parents, i.e. those y for which occurs. Although offering a richly expressive formalism subsuming both standard and bipolar AFs, an issue that arises with ADFs is whether this expressiveness is achieved in a manner that would be infeasible within standard AFs. Can the semantics used in ADFs be mapped to some AF semantics? How many arguments are needed in an AF to "simulate'' an ADF? We show that (in a formally defined sense) any ADF can be simulated by an AF of similar size and that this translation can be realised by a polynomial time algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-context systems (MCS) are a powerful framework for interlinking heterogeneous knowledge sources. They model the flow of information among different reasoning components (called contexts) in a declarative way, using so-called bridge rules, where contexts and bridge rules may be nonmonotonic. We considerably generalize MCS to managed MCS (mMCS): while the original bridge rules can only add information to contexts, our generalization allows arbitrary operations on context knowledge bases to be freely defined, e.g., deletion or revision operators. The paper motivates and introduces the generalized framework and presents several interesting instances. Furthermore, we consider inconsistency management in mMCS and complexity issues.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Query containment has been studied extensively in KR and databases, for different kinds of query languages and domain constraints. We address the longstanding open problem of containment under expressive description logic (DL) constraints for two-way regular path queries (2RPQs) and their conjunctions, which generalize conjunctive queries with the ability to express regular navigation. We show that, surprisingly, functionality constraints alone make containment of 2RPQs already ExpTime-hard. By employing automata-theoretic techniques, we also provide a matching upper bound that extends to very expressive DL constraints. For conjunctive 2RPQs we prove a further exponential jump in complexity, and provide again a matching upper bound for expressive DLs. Our techniques provide also a solution to the problem of query entailment over DL knowledge bases in which individuals in the ABox may be related through regular role-paths.</p>

Defeasible inheritance networks are a non-monotonic framework that deals with hierarchical knowledge. On the other hand, rational closure is acknowledged as a landmark of the preferential approach. We will combine these two approaches and define a new non-monotonic closure operation for propositional knowledge bases that combines the advantages of both. Then we redefine such a procedure for Description Logics, a family of logics well-suited to model structured information. In both cases we will provide a simple reasoning method that is build on top of the classical entailment relation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We identify a new representation of propositional knowledge bases, the Sentential Decision Diagram SDD, which is interesting for a number of reasons. First, it is canonical in the presence of additional properties that resemble reduction rules of OBDDs. Second, SDDs can be combined using any Boolean operator in polytime. Third, CNFs with n variables and treewidth w have canonical SDDs of size O(n 2w), which is tighter than the bound on OBDDs based on pathwidth. Finally, every OBDD is an SDD.

<p>【Abstract】:
This work develops an approach to efficient reasoning in first-order knowledge bases with incomplete information. We build on Levesque's proper knowledge bases approach, which supports limited incomplete knowledge in the form of a possibly infinite set of positive or negative ground facts. We propose a generalization which allows these facts to involve unknown individuals, as in the work on labeled null values in databases. Dealing with such unknown individuals has been shown to be a key feature in the database literature on data integration and data exchange. In this way, we obtain one of the most expressive first-order open-world settings for which reasoning can still be done efficiently by evaluation, as in relational databases. We show the soundness of the reasoning procedure and its completeness for queries in a certain normal form.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents an approach to belief revision in which revision is a function from a belief state and a finite set of formulas to a new belief state. In the interesting case, the set for revision S may be inconsistent but individual members of S are consistent. We argue that S will still contain interesting information regarding revision; in particular, maximum consistent subsets of S will determine candidate formulas for the revision process, and the agent's associated faithful ranking will determine the plausibility of such candidate formulas. Postulates and semantic conditions characterizing this approach are given, and representation results are provided. As a consequence of this approach, we argue that revision by a sequence of formulas, usually considered as a problem of iterated revision, is more appropriately regarded as revision by the possibly-inconsistent set of these formulas. Hence we suggest that revision by a sequence of formulas is foremost a problem of (uniterated) set revision.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper investigates belief revision where the underlying logic is that governing Horn clauses. It proves to be the case that classical (AGM) belief revision doesn’t immediately generalise to the Horn case. In particular, a standard construction based on a total preorder over possible worlds may violate the accepted (AGM) postulates. Conversely, Horn revision functions in the obvious extension to the AGM approach are not captured by total preorders over possible worlds. We address these difficulties by first restricting the semantic construction to "well behaved" orderings; and second, by augmenting the revision postulates by an additional postulate. This additional postulate is redundant in the AGM approach but not in the Horn case. In a representation result we show that these two approaches coincide. Arguably this work is interesting for several reasons. It extends AGM revision to inferentially-weaker Horn theories; hence it sheds light on the theoretical underpinnings of belief change, as well as generalising the AGM paradigm. Thus, this work is relevant to revision in areas that employ Horn clauses, such as deductive databases and logic programming, as well as areas in which inference is weaker than classical logic, such as in description logic.</p>

We compare the expressiveness of the fragments of Halpern and Shoham's interval logic (HS), i.e., of all interval logics with modal operators associated with Allen's relations between intervals in linear orders. We establish a complete set of inter-definability equations between these modal operators, and thus obtain a complete classification of the family of 212 fragments of HS with respect to their expressiveness. Using that result and a computer program, we have found that there are 1347 expressively different such interval logics over the class of all linear orders.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The concept of "ideal semantics" has been promoted as an alternative basis for skeptical reasoning within abstract argumentation settings. Informally, ideal acceptance not only requires an argument to be skeptically accepted in the traditional sense but further insists that the argument is in an admissible set all of whose arguments are also skeptically accepted. The original proposal was couched in terms of the so-called preferred semantics for abstract argumentation. We argue, in this paper, that the notion of "deal acceptability'' is applicable to arbitrary semantics and justify this claim by showing that standard properties of classical ideal semantics, e.g. unique status, continue to hold in any "reasonable" extension-based semantics. We categorise the relationship between the divers concepts of "ideal extension wrt semantics s" that arise and we present a comprehensive analysis of algorithmic and complexity-theoretic issues.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider an extension of the propositional modal logic S4 which allows &lt;&gt; to act not only on isolated formulas, but also on sets of formulas. The interpretation of &lt;&gt;A is then given by the tangled closure of the valuations of formulas in A, which over finite transitive, reflexive models indicates the existence of a cluster satisfying A. This extension has been shown to be more expressive than the basic modal language: for example, it is equivalent to the bisimulation-invariant fragment of FOL over finite S4 models, whereas the basic modal language is weaker. However, previous analyses of this logic have been entirely semantic, and no proof system was available. In this paper we present a sound proof system for the polyadic S4 and prove that it is complete. The axiomatization is fairly standard, adding only the fixpoint axioms of the tangled closure to the usual S4 axioms. The proof proceeds by explicitly constructing a finite model from a consistent set of formulas.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a unifying approach to the efficient evaluation of propositional answer-set programs. Our approach is based on backdoors which are small sets of atoms that represent "clever reasoning shortcuts" through the search space. The concept of backdoors is widely used in the areas of propositional satisfiability and constraint satisfaction. We show how this concept can be adapted to the nonmonotonic setting and how it allows to augment various known tractable subproblems, such as the evaluation of Horn and acyclic programs. In order to use backdoors we need to find them first. We utilize recent advances in fixed-parameter algorithmics to detect small backdoors. This implies fixed-parameter tractability of the evaluation of propositional answer-set programs, parameterized by the size of backdoors. Hence backdoor size provides a structural parameter similar to the treewidth parameter previously considered. We show that backdoor size and treewidth are incomparable, hence there are instances that are hard for one and easy for the other parameter. We complement our theoretical results with first empirical results.</p>

The focus of the paper is on a new tableau system for Dummett logic, for which we have an implementation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Proving that one language is more succinct than another becomes harder when the underlying semantics is stronger. We propose to use Formula-Size Games (as put forward by Adler and Immerman, 2003), games that are played on two sets of models, and that directly link the length of play with the size of the formula. Using those games, we prove three succinctness results for m-dimensional modal logic: (1) In system Km, a notion of `everybody knows' makes the resulting language exponentially more succinct for m &gt; 1, (2) In S5, the same language becomes more succinct for m &gt; 3 and (3) Public Announcement Logic is exponentially more succinct than S5m, if m &gt; 3. The latter settles an open problem raised by Lutz, 2006.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning concepts via instruction and expository texts is an important problem for modeling human learning and for making autonomous AI systems. This paper describes a computational model of the self-explanation effect, whereby conceptual knowledge is repaired by integrating and explaining new material. Our model represents conceptual knowledge with compositional model fragments, which are used to explain new material via model formulation. Preferences are computed over explanations and conceptual knowledge, along several dimensions. These preferences guide knowledge integration and question-answering. Our simulation learns about the human circulatory system, using facts from a circulatory system passage used in a previous cognitive psychology experiment. We analyze the simulation’s performance, showing that individual differences in sequences of models learned by students can be explained by different parameter settings in our model.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The robot programming and plan language IndiGolog allows for on-line execution of actions and offline projections of programs in dynamic and partly unknown environments. Basic assumptions are that the outcomes of primitive and sensing actions are correctly modeled, and that the agent is informed about all exogenous events beyond its control. In real-world applications, however, such assumptions do not hold. In fact, an action’s outcome is error-prone and sensing results are noisy. In this paper, we present a belief management system in IndiGolog that is able to detect inconsistencies between a robot’s modeled belief and what happened in reality. The system furthermore derives explanations and maintains a consistent belief. Our main contributions are (1) a belief management system following a history-based diagnosis approach that allows an agent to actively cope with faulty actions and the occurrence of exogenous events; and (2) an implementation in IndiGolog and experimental results from a delivery domain.</p>

We show the relationships to other meoreotopologies and to incidence geometry. The extension with betweenness, a primitive of relative position, results in a first-order theory that qualitatively abstracts ordered incidence geometry.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The last two decades has seen the emergence of many different probabilistic logics that use logical languages to specify, and sometimes reason, with probability distributions. Probabilistic logics that support reasoning with probability distributions, such as ProbLog, use an implicit definition of an interaction rule to combine probabilistic evidence about atoms. In this paper, we show that this interaction rule is an example of a more general class of interactions that can be described by non-monotonic logics. We furthermore show that such local interactions about the probability of an atom can be described by convolution. The resulting extended probabilistic logic supports non-monotonic reasoning with probabilistic information.</p>

We give a formal definition of generalized planning that is independent of any representation formalism. We assume that our generalized plans must work on a set of deterministic environments, which are essentially unrelated to each other. We prove that generalized planning for a finite set of environments is always decidable and EXPSPACE-complete. Our proof is constructive and gives us a sound, complete and complexity-wise optimal technique. We also consider infinite sets of environments, and show that generalized planning for the infinite "one-dimensional problems," known in the literature to be recursively enumerable when restricted to finite-state plans, is EXPSPACE-decidable without sequence functions, and solvable by generalized planning for finite sets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Boolean network is a mathematical model of biological systems, and has attracted much attention as a qualitative tool for analyzing the regulatory system. The stable states and dynamics of Boolean networks are characterized by their attractors, whose properties have been analyzed computationally, yet not much work has been done from the viewpoint of logical inference systems. In this paper, we show direct translations of Boolean networks into logic programs, and propose new methods to compute their trajectories and attractors based on inference on such logic programs. In particular, point attractors of both synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks are characterized as supported models of logic programs so that SAT techniques can be applied to compute them. Investigation of these relationships suggests us to view Boolean networks as logic programs and vice versa.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Temporal reasoning problems arise in many areas of AI, including planning, natural language understanding, and reasoning about physical systems. The computational complexity of continuous-time temporal constraint reasoning is fairly well understood. There are, however, many different cases where discrete time must be considered; various scheduling problems and reasoning about sampled physical systems are two examples. Here, the complexity of temporal reasoning is not as well-studied nor as well-understood. In order to get a better understanding, we consider the powerful Horn DLR formalism adapted for discrete time and study its computational complexity. We show that the full formalism is NP-hard and identify several maximal tractable subclasses. We also ‘lift’ the maximality results to obtain hardness results for other families of constraints. Finally, we discuss how the results and techniques presented in this paper can be used for studying even more expressive classes of temporal constraints.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent years have seen a lot of work towards extending the established AGM belief revision theory with respect to iterating revision, preserving conditional beliefs, and handling sets of propositions as new information. In particular, novel postulates like independence and evidence retainment have been brought forth as new standards for revising epistemic states by (sets of) propositional information. In this paper, we propose a constructive approach for revising epistemic states by sets of (propositional and conditional) beliefs that combines ideas from nonmonotonic reasoning with conditional belief revision. We also propose a novel principle called enforcement that covers both independence and evidence retainment, and we show our revision operator to comply with major postulates from the literature. Moreover, we point out the relevance of our approach for default reasoning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many applications of causal inference, such as finding the relationship between stock prices and news reports, involve both discrete and continuous variables observed over time. Inference with these complex sets of temporal data, though, has remained difficult and required a number of simplifications. We show that recent approaches for inferring temporal relationships (represented as logical formulas) can be adapted for inference with continuous valued effects. Building on advances in logic, PCTLc (an extension of PCTL with numerical constraints) is introduced here to allow representation and inference of relationships with a mixture of discrete and continuous components. Then, finding significant relationships in the continuous case can be done using the conditional expectation of an effect, rather than its conditional probability. We evaluate this approach on both synthetically generated and actual financial market data, demonstrating that it can allow us to answer different questions than the discrete approach can.</p>

Existing belief merging operators take advantage of all the models from the bases, including those contradicting the integrity constraints. In this paper, we show that this is not suited to every merging scenario. We study the case when the bases are "rationalized" with respect to the integrity constraints during the merging process. We define in formal terms several independence conditions for merging operators and show how they interact with the standard IC postulates for belief merging. Especially, we give an independence-based axiomatic characterization of a distance-based operator.</p>

We investigate (quantifier-free) spatial constraint languages with equality, contact and connectedness predicates as well as Boolean operations on regions, interpreted over low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. We show that the complexity of reasoning varies dramatically depending on the dimension of the space and on the type of regions considered. For example, the logic with the interior-connectedness predicate (and without contact) is undecidable over polygons or regular closed sets in the Euclidean plane, NP-complete over regular closed sets in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and ExpTime-complete over polyhedra in three-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Existential rules, i.e. Datalog extended with existential quantifiers in rule heads, are currently studied under a variety of names such as Datalog +/-, ∀∃-rules, and tuple-generating dependencies. The renewed interest in this formalism is fuelled by a wealth of recently discovered language fragments for which query answering is decidable. This paper extends and consolidates two of the main approaches in this field — acyclicity and guardedness — by providing (1) complexity-preserving generalisations of weakly acyclic and weakly (frontier-)guarded rules, and (2) a novel formalism of glut-(frontier-)guarded rules that subsumes both. This builds on an insight that acyclicity can be used to extend any existential rule language while retaining decidability. Besides decidability, combined query complexities are established in all cases.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In a document network such as a citation network of scientific documents, web-logs etc., the content produced by authors exhibit their interest in certain topics. In addition some authors influence other authors' interests. In this work, we propose to model the influence of cited authors along with the interests of citing authors. Morover , we hypothesize that citations present in documents, the context surrounding the citation mention provides extra topical information about the cited authors. However, associating terms in the context to the cited authors remains an open problem. We propose novel document generation schemes that incorporate the context while simultaneously modeling the interests of citing authors and influence of the cited authors. Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline models for various evaluation criteria such as link prediction between document and cited author, and quantitatively explaining unseen text.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In a seminal paper, Lin and Reiter introduced the notion of progression for basic action theories in the situation calculus. Earlier works by Moore, Scherl and Levesque extended the situation calculus to account for knowledge. In this paper, we study progression of knowledge in the situation calculus. We first adapt the concept of bisimulation from modal logic and extend Lin and Reiter's notion of progression to accommodate knowledge. We show that for physical actions, progression of knowledge reduces to forgetting predicates in first-order modal logic. We identify a class of first-order modal formulas for which forgetting an atom is definable in first-order modal logic. This class of formulas goes beyond formulas without quantifying-in. We also identify a simple case where forgetting a predicate reduces to forgetting a finite number of atoms. Thus we are able to show that for local-effect physical actions, when the initial KB is a formula in this class, progression of knowledge is definable in first-order modal logic. Finally, we extend our results to the multi-agent case.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We characterize the expressive power of description logic (DL) TBoxes, both for expressive DLs such as ALC and ALCQIO and lightweight DLs such as DL-Lite and EL. Our characterizations are relative to first-order logic, based on a wide range of semantic notions such as bisimulation, equisimulation, disjoint union, and direct product. We exemplify the use of the characterizations by a first study of the following novel family of decision problems: given a TBox T formulated in one DL, decide whether T can be equivalently rewritten as a TBox in der fragment L' of L.</p>

We study uniform interpolation and forgetting in the description logic ALC. Our main results are model-theoretic characterizations of uniform interpolants and their existence in terms of bisimulations, tight complexity bounds for deciding the existence of uniform interpolants, an approach to computing interpolants when they exist, and tight bounds on their size. We use a mix of model-theoretic and automata-theoretic methods that, as a by-product, also provides charachterizations of, and decision procedures for, conservative extensions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study the existential closures of several propositional languages L considered recently as target languages for knowledge compilation (KC), namely the incomplete fragments KROM-C, HORN-C, K/H-C, renH-C, AFF, and the corresponding disjunction closures KROM-C[V], HORN-C[V], K/H-C[V], renH-C[V], and AFF[V]. We analyze the queries, transformations, expressiveness and succinctness of the resulting languages L[E] in order to locate them in the KC map. As a by-product, we also address several issues concerning disjunction closures that were left open so far. From our investigation, the language HORN-C[V, E] (where disjunctions and existential quantifications can be applied to Horn CNF formulae) appears as an interesting target language for the KC purpose, challenging the influential DNNF languages.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Despite the importance of propositional logic in artificial intelligence, the notion of language independence in the propositional setting (not to be confound with syntax independence) has not received much attention so far. In this paper, we define language independence for a propositional operator as robustness w.r.t.symbol translation. We provide a number of characterizations results for such translations. We motivate the need to focus on symbol translations of restricted types, and identify several families of interest. We identify the computational complexity of recognizing symbol translations from those families. Finally, as a case study, we investigate the robustness of belief revision/merging operators w.r.t. translations of different types. It turns out that rational belief revision/merging operators are not guaranteed to offer the most basic (yet non-trivial) form of language independence; operators based on the Hamming distance do not suffer from this drawback but are less robust than operators based on the drastic distance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We formalize reasoning about fuzzy belief and fuzzy common belief, especially incomparable beliefs, in multi-agent systems by using a logical system based on Fitting's many-valued modal logic, where incomparable beliefs mean beliefs whose degrees are not totally ordered. Completeness and decidability results for the logic of fuzzy belief and common belief are established while implicitly exploiting the duality-theoretic perspective on Fitting's logic that builds upon the author's previous work. A conceptually novel feature is that incomparable beliefs and qualitative fuzziness can be formalized in the developed system, whereas they cannot be formalized in previously proposed systems for reasoning about fuzzy belief. We believe that belief degrees can ultimately be reduced to truth degrees, and we call this "the reduction thesis about belief degrees," which is assumed in the present paper and motivates an axiom of our system. We finally argue that fuzzy reasoning sheds new light on old epistemic issues such as coordinated attack problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The ability to predict, or at least recognize, the state of the world that an action brings about, is a central feature of autonomous agents. We propose, herein, a formal framework within which we investigate whether this ability can be autonomously learned. The framework makes explicit certain premises that we contend are central in such a learning task: (i) slow sensors may prevent the sensing of an action's direct effects during learning; (ii) predictions need to be made reliably in future and novel situations. We initiate in this work a thorough investigation of the conditions under which learning is or is not feasible. Despite the very strong negative learnability results that we obtain, we also identify interesting special cases where learning is feasible and useful.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The ASPIC+ framework is intermediate in abstraction between Dung's argumentation framework and concrete instantiating logics. This paper generalises ASPIC+ to accommodate classical logic instantiations, and adopts a new proposal for evaluating extensions: attacks are used to define the notion of conflict-free sets, while the defeats obtained by applying preferences to attacks, are exclusively used to determine the acceptability of arguments. Key properties and rationality postulates are then shown to hold for the new framework.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Quality control is an essential task within ontology development projects especially when the knowledge formalization is partially automatized. In this paper, we propose a reasoning-based, interactive approach to support the revision of formalized knowledge. We state consistency criteria for revision states and introduce the notion of revision closure, based on which the revision of ontologies is partially automatized. Additionally, we propose a notion of axiom impact which is used to determine a beneficial order of axiom evaluation in order to further increase the effectiveness of ontology revision. Finally, we develop the notion of decision spaces, which are structures for calculating and updating the revision closure and axiom impact. The use of decision spaces saves on average 75% of the costly reasoning operations during a revision.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a new and compelling approach to the efficient solution of important computational problems that arise in the context of abstract argumentation. Our approach makes known algorithms defined for restricted fragments generally applicable, at a computational cost that scales with the distance from the fragment. Thus, in a certain sense, we gradually augment tractable fragments. Surprisingly, it turns out that some tractable fragments admit such an augmentation and that others do not. More specifically, we show that the problems of credulous and skeptical acceptance are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the distance from the fragment of acyclic argumentation frameworks. Other tractable fragments such as the fragments of symmetrical and bipartite frameworks seem to prohibit an augmentation: the acceptance problems are already intractable for frameworks at distance 1 from the fragments. For our study we use a broad setting and consider several different semantics. For the algorithmic results we utilize recent advances in fixed-parameter tractability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The high computational complexity of the expressive Description Logics (DLs) that underlie the OWL standard has motivated the study of their Horn fragments, which are usually tractable in data complexity and can also have lower combined complexity, particularly for query answering. In this paper we provide algorithms for answering conjunctive 2-way regular path queries (2CRPQs), a non-trivial generalization of plain conjunctive queries, in the Horn fragments of the DLs SHOIQ and SROIQ underlying OWL 1 and OWL 2. We show that the combined complexity of the problem is ExpTime-complete for Horn-SHOIQ and 2ExpTime-complete for the more expressive Horn-SROIQ, but is PTime-complete in data complexity for both. In contrast, even decidability of plain conjunctive queries is still open for full SHOIQ and SROIQ. These are the first completeness results for query answering in DLs with inverses, nominals, and counting, and show that for the considered logics the problem is not more expensive than standard reasoning.</p>

This corresponds to a certain minimal kind of KSD model and yields a new type of nonmonotonic doxastic reasonin</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study the problem of dealing with inconsistency in Description Logic (DL) ontologies. We consider inconsistency-tolerant semantics recently proposed in the literature, called AR-semantics and CAR-semantics, which are based on repairing (i.e., modifying) in a minimal way the extensional knowledge (ABox) while keeping the intensional knowledge (TBox) untouched. We study instance checking and conjunctive query entailment under the above inconsistency-tolerant semantics for a wide spectrum of DLs, ranging from tractable ones (EL) to very expressive ones (SHIQ), showing that reasoning under the above semantics is inherently intractable, even for very simple DLs. To the aim of overcoming such a high computational complexity of reasoning, we study sound approximations of the above semantics. Surprisingly, our computational analysis shows that reasoning under the approximated semantics is intractable even for tractable DLs. Finally, we identify suitable language restrictions of such DLs allowing for tractable reasoning under inconsistency-tolerant semantics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper studies a computational logic for dishonest reasoning. We introduce logic programs with disinformation to represent and reason with dishonesty. We then consider two different cases of dishonesty: deductive dishonesty and abductive dishonesty. The former misleads another agent to deduce wrong conclusions, while the latter interrupts another agent to abduce correct explanations. In deductive or abductive dishonesty, an agent can perform different types of dishonest reasoning such as lying, bullshitting, and withholding information. We show that these different types of dishonest reasoning are characterized by extended abduction, and address their computational methods using abductive logic programming.</p>

The paper introduces a logical framework for negotiation among dishonest agents. The framework relies on the use of abductive logic programming as a knowledge representation language for agents to deal with incomplete information and preferences. The paper shows how intentionally false or inaccurate information of agents could be encoded in the agents' knowledge bases. Such disinformation can be effectively used in the process of negotiation to have desired outcomes by agents. The negotiation processes are formulated under the answer set semantics of abductive logic programming and enable the exploration of various strategies that agents can employ in their negotiation</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Uncertainty and vagueness are pervasive phenomena in real-life knowledge. They are supported in extended description logics that adapt classical description logics to deal with numerical probabilities or fuzzy truth degrees. While the two concepts are distinguished for good reasons, they combine in the notion of probably, which is ultimately a fuzzy qualification of probabilities. Here, we develop existing propositional logics of fuzzy probability into a full-blown description logic, and we show decidability of several variants of this logic under Lukasiewicz semantics. We obtain these results in a novel generic framework of fuzzy coalgebraic logic; this enables us to extend our results to logics that combine crisp ingredients including standard crisp roles and crisp numerical probabilities with fuzzy roles and fuzzy probabilities.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Fages [1994] introduces the notion of well-supportedness as a key requirement for the semantics of normal logic programs and characterizes the standard answer set semantics in terms of the well-supportedness condition. With the property of well-supportedness, answer sets are guaranteed to be free of circular justifications. In this paper, we extend Fages’ work to description logic programs (or DL-programs). We introduce two forms of well-supportedness for DL-programs. The first one defines weakly well-supported models that are free of circular justifications caused by positive literals in rule bodies. The second one defines strongly well-supported models that are free of circular justifications caused by either positive or negative literals. We then define two new answer set semantics for DL-programs and characterize them in terms of the weakly and strongly well-supported models, respectively. The first semantics is based on an extended Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation and defines weakly well-supported answer sets that are free of circular justifications for the class of DL-programs without negative dl-atoms. The second semantics defines strongly well-supported answer sets which are free of circular justifications for all DL-programs. We show that the existing answer set semantics for DL-programs, such as the weak answer set semantics, the strong answer set semantics, and the FLP-based answer set semantics, satisfy neither the weak nor the strong well-supportedness condition, even for DL-programs without negative dl-atoms. This explains why their answer sets incur circular justifications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a new approach based on model relaxation to compute minimum-cardinality diagnoses of a (faulty) system: We obtain a relaxed model of the system by splitting nodes in the system and compile the abstraction of the relaxed model into DNNF. Abstraction is obtained by treating self-contained sub-systems called cones as single components. We then use a novel branch-and-bound search algorithm and compute the abstract minimum-cardinality diagnoses of the system, which are later refined hierarchically, in a careful manner, to get all minimum-cardinality diagnoses of the system. Experiments on ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits show that the new approach is faster than the previous state-of-the-art hierarchical approach, and scales to all circuits in the suite for the first time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consequence-based ontology reasoning procedures have so far been known only for Horn ontology languages. A difficulty in extending such procedures is that non-Horn axioms seem to require reasoning by case, which causes non-determinism in tableau-based procedures. In this paper we present a consequence-based procedure for ALCH that overcomes this difficulty by using rules similar to ordered resolution to deal with disjunctive axioms in a deterministic way; it retains all the favourable attributes of existing consequence-based procedures, such as goal-directed “one pass” classification, optimal worst-case complexity, and “pay-asyou- go” behaviour. Our preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the procedure scales well to non-Horn ontologies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Beth definability property, a well-known property from classical logic, is investigated in the context of description logics (DLs): if a general L-TBox implicitly defines an L-concept in terms of a given signature, where L is a DL, then does there always exist over this signature an explicit definition in L for the concept? This property has been studied before and used to optimize reasoning in DLs. In this paper a complete classification of Beth definability is provided for extensions of the basic DL ALC with transitive roles, inverse roles, role hierarchies, and/or functionality restrictions, both on arbitrary and on finite structures. Moreover, we present a tableau-based algorithm which computes explicit definitions of at most double exponential size. This algorithm is optimal because it is also shown that the smallest explicit definition of an implicitly defined concept may be double exponentially long in the size of the input TBox. Finally, if explicit definitions are allowed to be expressed in first-order logic then we show how to compute them in EXPTIME.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Game Description Language is a high-level, rule-based formalisms for communicating the rules of arbitrary games to general game-playing systems, whose challenging task is to learn to play previously unknown games without human intervention. Originally designed for deterministic games with complete information about the game state, the language was recently extended to include randomness and imperfect information. However, determining the extent to which this enhancement allows to describe truly arbitrary games was left as an open problem. We provide a positive answer to this question by relating the extended Game Description Language to the universal, mathematical concept of extensive-form games, proving that indeed just any such game can be described faithfully.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Carneades is a recently proposed formalism for structured argumentation with varying proof standards. An open question is its relation with Dung's seminal abstract approach to argumentation. In this paper the two formalisms are formally related by translating Carneades into ASPIC+, another recently proposed formalism for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ is defined to generate Dung-style abstract argumentation frameworks, this in effect translates Carneades graphs into abstract argumentation frameworks. It is proven that Carneades always induces a unique Dung extension, which is the same in all of Dung's semantics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The generation of route descriptions is a fundamental task of navigation systems. A particular problem in this context is to identify routes that can easily be described and processed by users. In this work, we present a framework for representing route networks with the qualitative information necessary to evaluate and optimize route descriptions with regard to ambiguities in them. We identify different agent models that differ in how agents are assumed to process route descriptions while navigating through route networks. Further, we analyze the computational complexity of matching route descriptions and paths in route networks in dependency of the agent model. Finally we empirically evaluate the influence of the agent model on the optimization and the processing of route instructions.</p>

This paper focuses on computing first-order theories under either stable model semantics or circumscription. A reduction from first-order theories to logic programs under stable model semantics over finite structures is proposed, and an embedding of circumscription into stable model semantics is also given. Having such reduction and embedding, reasoning problems represented by first-order theories under these two semantics can then be handled by using existing answer set solvers. The effectiveness of this approach in computing hard problems beyond NP is demonstrated by some experiments.</p>

Following the recent trend of studying the theory of belief revision under the Horn fragment of propo- sitional logic this paper develops a fully charac- terised Horn contraction which is analogous to the traditional transitively relational partial meet contraction [Alchourron et al., 1985]. This Horn con- traction extends the partial meet Horn contraction studied in [Delgrande and Wassermann, 2010] so that it is guided by a transitive relation that models the ordering of plausibility over sets of beliefs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Selecting a clustering algorithm is a perplexing task. Yet since different algorithms may yield dramatically different outputs on the same data, the choice of algorithm is crucial. When selecting a clustering algorithm, users tend to focus on cost-related considerations (software purchasing costs, running times, etc). Differences concerning the output of the algorithms are not usually considered. Recently, a formal approach for selecting a clustering algorithm has been proposed (Ackerman, Ben-David, and Loker, NIPS 2010). The approach involves distilling abstract properties of the input-output behavior of different clustering paradigms and classifying algorithms based on these properties. In this paper, we extend this approach into the hierarchical setting. The class of linkage-based algorithms is perhaps the most popular class of hierarchical algorithms. We identify two properties of hierarchical algorithms, and prove that linkage-based algorithms are the only ones that satisfy both of these properties. Our characterization clearly delineates the difference between linkage-based algorithms and other hierarchical algorithms. We formulate an intuitive notion of locality of a hierarchical algorithm that distinguishes between linkage-based and "global" hierarchical algorithms like bisecting k-means, and prove that popular divisive hierarchical algorithms produce clusterings that cannot be produced by any linkage-based algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this work we propose an approach for generalization in continuous domain Reinforcement Learning that, instead of using a single function approximator, tries many different function approximators in parallel, each one defined in a different region of the domain. Associated with each approximator is a relevance function that locally quantifies the quality of its approximation, so that, at each input point, the approximator with highest relevance can be selected. The relevance function is defined using parametric estimations of the variance of the q-values and the density of samples in the input space, which are used to quantify the accuracy and the confidence in the approximation, respectively. These parametric estimations are obtained from a probability density distribution represented as a Gaussian Mixture Model embedded in the input-output space of each approximator. In our experiments, the proposed approach required a lesser number of experiences for learning and produced more stable convergence profiles than when using a single function approximator.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Lifted message passing algorithms exploit repeated structure within a given graphical model to answer queries efficiently. Given evidence, they construct a lifted network of supernodes and superpotentials corresponding to sets of nodes and potentials that are indistinguishable given the evidence. Recently, efficient algorithms were presented for updating the structure of an existing lifted network with incremental changes to the evidence. In the inference stage, however, current algorithms need to construct a separate lifted network for each evidence case and run a modified message passing algorithm on each lifted network separately. Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases. The benefits of this multi-evidence lifted inference are shown for several important AI tasks such as computing personalized PageRanks and Kalman filters via multi-evidence lifted Gaussian belief propagation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose a new framework for constructing text metrics which can be used to compare and support inferences among terms and sets of terms. Our metric is derived from data-driven kernels on graphs that let us capture global relations among terms and sets of terms, regardless of their complexity and size. To compute the metric efficiently for any two subsets of terms, we develop an approximation technique that relies on the precompiled term-term similarities. To scale-up the approach to problems with huge number of terms, we develop and experiment with a solution that subsamples the term space. We demonstrate the benefits of the whole framework on two text inference tasks: prediction of terms in the article from its abstract and query expansion in information retrieval.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic classification model to address the task of semi-supervised learning. The major novelty of our proposal stems from measuring distributional relationships between the labeled and unlabeled data. This is achieved from a stochastic translation model between data distributions that is estimated from a mixture model. The proposed classifier is defined from the combination of both the translation model and a kernel logistic regression on labeled data. Experimental results obtained over synthetic and real-world data sets validate the usefulness of our proposal.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Topic models have been used successfully for a variety of problems, often in the form of application-specific extensions of the basic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Because deriving these new models in order to encode domain knowledge can be difficult and time-consuming, we propose the Fold·all model, which allows the user to specify general domain knowledge in First-Order Logic (FOL). However, combining topic modeling with FOL can result in inference problems beyond the capabilities of existing techniques. We have therefore developed a scalable inference technique using stochastic gradient descent which may also be useful to the Markov Logic Network (MLN) research community. Experiments demonstrate the expresive power of Fold·all, as well as the scalability of our proposed inference method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Topic models have a wide range of applications, including modeling of text documents, images, user preferences, product rankings, and many others. However, learning optimal models may be difficult, especially for large problems. The reason is that inference techniques such as Gibbs sampling often converge to suboptimal models due to the abundance of local minima in large datasets. In this paper, we propose a general method of improving the performance of topic models. The method, called 'grouping transform', works by introducing auxiliary variables which represent assignments of the original model tokens to groups. Using these auxiliary variables, it becomes possible to resample an entire group of tokens at a time. This allows the sampler to make larger state space moves. As a result, better models are learned and performance is improved. The proposed ideas are illustrated on several topic models and several text and image datasets. We show that the grouping transform significantly improves performance over standard models.</p>

In this paper, we study the problem of learning ametric and propose a loss function based metriclearning framework, in which the metric is estimatedby minimizing an empirical risk over a trainingset. With mild conditions on the instance distributionand the used loss function, we prove that theempirical risk converges to its expected counterpartat rate O(1/\sqrt{n}), wherein n is the cardinality of the training set. In addition, with the assumption thatthe best metric that minimizes the expected risk isbounded, we prove that the learned metric is consistent. Two example algorithms are presented by usingthe proposed loss function based metric learningframework, each of which uses a log loss functionand a smoothed hinge loss function, respectively. Experimental results on data sets from the UCI machine learning repository suggest the effectivenessof the proposed algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Sequence classification is central to many practical problems within machine learning. Distances metrics between arbitrary pairs of sequences can be hard to define because sequences can vary in length and the information contained in the order of sequence elements is lost when standard metrics such as Euclidean distance are applied. We present a scheme that employs a Hidden Markov Model variant to produce a set of fixed-length description vectors from a set of sequences. We then define three inference algorithms, a Baum-Welch variant, a Gibbs Sampling algorithm, and a variational algorithm, to infer model parameters. Finally, we show experimentally that the fixed length representation produced by these inference methods is useful for classifying sequences of amino acids into structural classes</p>

Multi-objective optimization problems arise frequently in applications but can often only be solved approximately by heuristic approaches. Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used to tackle multi-objective problems. These algorithms use different measures to ensure diversity in the objective space but are not guided by a formal notion of approximation. We present a new framework of an evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective optimization that allows to work with a formal notion of approximation. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of the quality of the approximation that is obtained in particular for problems with many objectives.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning distance metrics is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Previous distance-metric learning research assumes that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution, which may be violated in practical applications. When the distributions differ, a situation referred to as covariate shift, the metric learned from training data may not work well on the test data. In this case the metric is said to be inconsistent. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel metric learning framework known as consistent distance metric learning (CDML), which solves the problem under covariate shift situations. We theoretically analyze the conditions when the metrics learned under covariate shift are consistent. Based on the analysis, a convex optimization problem is proposed to deal with the CDML problem. An importance sampling method is proposed for metric learning and two importance weighting strategies are proposed and compared in this work. Experiments are carried out on synthetic and real world datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we propose to combine three AI techniques to speed up a Reinforcement Learning algorithm in a Transfer Learning problem: Case-based Reasoning, Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks. To do so, we propose a new algorithm, called L3, which works in 3 stages: in the first stage, it uses Reinforcement Learning to learn how to perform one task, and stores the optimal policy for this problem as a case-base; in the second stage, it uses a Neural Network to map actions from one domain to actions in the other domain and; in the third stage, it uses the case-base learned in the first stage as heuristics to speed up the learning performance in a related, but different, task. The RL algorithm used in the first phase is the Q-learning and in the third phase is the recently proposed Case-based Heuristically Accelerated Q-learning. A set of empirical evaluations were conducted in transferring the learning between two domains, the Acrobot and the Robocup 3D: the policy learned during the solution of the Acrobot Problem is transferred and used to speed up the learning of stability policies for a humanoid robot in the Robocup 3D simulator. The results show that the use of this algorithm can lead to a significant improvement in the performance of the agent.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In recent years, the summarisation and decomposition of social networks has become increasingly popular, from community finding to role equivalence. However, these approaches concentrate on one type of model only. Generalised block modelling decomposes a network into independent, interpretable, labeled blocks, where the block labels summarise the relationship between two sets of users. Existing algorithms for fitting generalised block models do not scale beyond networks of 100 vertices. In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms, one based on genetic algorithms and the other on simulated annealing, that is at least two orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms and obtaining similar accuracy. Using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate their efficiency and accuracy and show how generalised block modelling and our new approaches enable tractable network summarisation and modelling of medium sized networks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The rapid construction of supervised text classification models is becoming a pervasive need across many modern applications. To reduce human-labeling bottlenecks, many new statistical paradigms (e.g., active, semi-supervised, transfer and multi-task learning) have been vigorously pursued in recent literature with varying degrees of empirical success. Concurrently, the emergence of Web 2.0 platforms in the last decade has enabled a world-wide, collaborative human effort to construct a massive ontology of concepts with very rich, detailed and accurate descriptions. In this paper we propose a new framework to extract supervisory information from such ontologies and complement it with a shift in human effort from direct labeling of examples in the domain of interest to the much more efficient identification of concept-class associations. Through empirical studies on text categorization problems using the Wikipedia ontology, we show that this shift allows very high-quality models to be immediately induced at virtually no cost.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many unsupervised learning methods for recognising patterns in data streams are based on fixed length data sequences, which makes them unsuitable for applications where the data sequences are of variable length such as in speech recognition, behaviour recognition and text classification. In order to use these methods on variable length data sequences, a pre-processing step is required to manually segment the data and select the appropriate features, which is often not practical in real-world applications. In this paper we suggest an unsupervised learning method that handles variable length data sequences by identifying structure in the data stream using text compression and the edit distance between ‘words’. We demonstrate that using this method we can automatically cluster unlabelled data in a data stream and perform segmentation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method using both fixed length and variable length benchmark datasets, comparing it to the Self-Organising Map in the first case. The results show a promising improvement over baseline recognition systems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional Neural Network variants. Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed nor pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical architectures achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object classification (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with error rates of 2.53%, 19.51%, 0.35%, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs. Test error rates on MNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after 1, 3 and 17 epochs, respectively.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular technique for building decision-making agents from human help. Traditional LfD methods use demonstrations as training examples for supervised learning, but complex tasks can require more examples than is practical to obtain. We present Abstraction from Demonstration (AfD), a novel form of LfD that uses demonstrations to infer state abstractions and reinforcement learning (RL) methods in those abstract state spaces to build a policy. Empirical results show that AfD is greater than an order of magnitude more sample efficient than jus tusing demonstrations as training examples, and exponentially faster than RL alone.</p>

In this paper we present a new algorithm for generatively learning the structure of Markov Logic Networks. This algorithm relies on a graph of predicates, which summarizes the links existing between predicates and on relational information between ground atoms in the training database. Candidate clauses are produced by means of a heuristical variabilization technique. According to our first experiments, this approach appears to be promising.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present Constituent Grammatical Evolution (CGE), a new evolutionary automatic programming algorithm that extends the standard Grammatical Evolution algorithm by incorporating the concepts of constituent genes and conditional behaviour-switching. CGE builds from elementary and more complex building blocks a control program which dictates the behaviour of an agent and it is applicable to the class of problems where the subject of search is the behaviour of an agent in a given environment. It takes advantage of the powerful Grammatical Evolution feature of using a BNF grammar definition as a plug-in component to describe the output language to be produced by the system. The main benchmark problem in which CGE is evaluated is the Santa Fe Trail problem using a BNF grammar definition which defines a search space semantically equivalent with that of the original definition of the problem by Koza. Furthermore, CGE is evaluated on two additional problems, the Los Altos Hills and the Hampton Court Maze. The experimental results demonstrate that Constituent Grammatical Evolution outperforms the standard Grammatical Evolution algorithm in these problems, in terms of both efficiency (percent of solutions found) and effectiveness (number of required steps of solutions found).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we consider a (possibly continuous) space of Bernoulli experiments. We assume that the Bernoulli distributions of the points are correlated. All evidence data comes in the form of successful or failed experiments at different points. Current state-of-the-art methods for expressing a distribution over a continuum of Bernoulli distributions use logistic Gaussian processes or Gaussian copula processes. However, both of these require computationally expensive matrix operations (cubic in the general case). We introduce a more intuitive approach, directly correlating beta distributions by sharing evidence between them according to a kernel function, an approach which has linear time complexity. The approach can easily be extended to multiple outcomes, giving a continuous correlated Dirichlet process.This approach can be used for classification (both binary and multi-class) and learning the actual probabilities of the Bernoulli distributions. We show results for a number of data sets, as well as a case-study where a mixture of continuous beta processes is used as part of an automated stroke rehabilitation system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
L1-regularized least squares, with the ability of discovering sparse representations, is quite prevalent in the field of machine learning, statistics and signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Dual Projected Newton Method (DPNM) to solve the L1-regularized least squares problem. In DPNM, we first derive a new dual problem as a box constrained quadratic programming. Then, a projected Newton method is utilized to solve the dual problem, achieving a quadratic convergence rate. Moreover, we propose to utilize some practical techniques, thus it greatly reduces the computational cost and makes DPNM more efficient. Experimental results on six real-world data sets indicate that DPNM is very efficient for solving the L1-regularized least squares problem, by comparing it with state of the art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning from streaming data represents an important and challenging task. Maintaining an accurate model, while the stream goes by, requires a smart way for tracking data changes through time, originating concept drift. One way to treat this kind of problem is to resort to ensemble-based techniques. In this context, the advent of new technologies related to web and ubiquitous services call for the need of new learning approaches able to deal with structured-complex information, such as trees. Kernel methods enable the modeling of structured data in learning algorithms, however they are computationally demanding. The contribute of this work is to show how an effective ensemble-based approach can be deviced for streams of trees by optimizing the kernel-based model representation. Both efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach are assessed for different models by using data sets exhibiting different levels and types of concept drift.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Combining graph regularization with nonnegative matrix (tri-)factorization (NMF) has shown great performance improvement compared with traditional nonnegative matrix (tri-)factorization models due to its ability to utilize the geometric structure of the documents and words. In this paper, we show that these models are not well-defined and suffering from trivial solution and scale transfer problems. In order to solve these common problems, we propose two models for graph regularized nonnegative matrix (tri-)factorization, which can be applied for document clustering and co-clustering respectively. In the proposed models, a Normalized Cut-like constraint is imposed on the cluster assignment matrix to make the optimization problem well-defined. We derive a multiplicative updating algorithm for the proposed models, and prove its convergence. Experiments of clustering and co-clustering on benchmark text data sets demonstratethat the proposed models outperform the originalmodels as well as many other state-of-the-art clustering methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Dimensionality reduction is a very important topic in machine learning. It can be generally classified into two categories: feature selection and subspace learning. In the past decades, many methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction. However, most of these works study feature selection and subspace learning independently. In this paper, we present a framework for joint feature selection and subspace learning. We reformulate the subspace learning problem and use L2,1-norm on the projection matrix to achieve row-sparsity, which leads to selecting relevant features and learning transformation simultaneously. We discuss two situations of the proposed framework, and present their optimization algorithms. Experiments on benchmark face recognition data sets illustrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state of the art methods overwhelmingly.</p>

The proposed model is a cyclic directed graphical model, which provides an intuitive representation for the dependencies among multiple label variables, and a well integrated framework for efficient model training using binary classifiers and label predictions using Gibbs sampling inference. Our experiments show the proposed conditional model can effectively exploit the label dependency to improve multi-label classification performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most of the sequential patterns extraction methods proposed so far deal with patterns composed of events linked by temporal relationships based on simple precedence between instants. In many real situations, some quantitative information about event duration or inter-event delay is necessary to discriminate phenomena. We propose the algorithm QTIPrefixSpan for extracting temporal patterns composed of events to which temporal intervals describing their position in time and their duration are associated. It extends algorithm PrefixSpan with a multi-dimensional interval clustering step for extracting the representative temporal intervals associated to events in patterns. Experiments on simulated data show that our algorithm is efficient for extracting precise patterns even in noisy contexts and that it improves the performance of a former algorithm which used a clustering method based on the EM algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We conjecture that the distribution of the time-reversed residuals of a causal linear process is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the noise used to generate the process in the forward direction. This property is demonstrated for causal AR(1) processes assuming that all the cumulants of the distribution of the noise are defined. Based on this observation, it is possible to design a decision rule for detecting the direction of time series that can be described as linear processes: The correct direction (forward in time) is the one in which the residuals from a linear fit to the time series are less Gaussian. A series of experiments with simulated and real-world data illustrate the superior results of the proposed rule when compared with other state-of-the-art methods based on independence tests.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The problem of feature selection has aroused considerable research interests in the past few years. Traditional learning based feature selection methods separate embedding learning and feature ranking. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised feature selection approach via Joint Embedding Learning and Sparse Regression (JELSR). Instead of simply employing the graph laplacian for embedding learning and then regression, we use the weight via locally linear approximation to construct graph and unify embedding learning and sparse regression to perform feature selection. By adding the l2,1-norm regularization, we can learn a sparse matrix for feature ranking. We also provide an effective method to solve the proposed problem. Compared with traditional unsupervised feature selection methods, our approach could integrate the merits of embedding learning and sparse regression simultaneously. Plenty of experimental results are provided to show the validity.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning regression rules by transforming the regression problem into a classification problem. Unlike previous approaches to regression by classification, in our approach the discretization of the class variable is tightly integrated into the rule learning algorithm. The key idea is to dynamically define a region around the target value predicted by the rule, and considering all examples within that region as positive and all examples outside that region as negative. In this way, conventional rule learning heuristics may be used for inducing regression rules. Our results show that our heuristic algorithm outperforms approaches that use a static discretization of the target variable, and performs en par with other comparable rule-based approaches, albeit without reaching the performance of statistical approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The mixture of multivariate Bernoulli distributions (MMB) is a statistical model for high-dimensional binary data in widespread use. Recently, the MMB has been used to model the sequence of packet receptions and losses of wireless links in sensor networks. Given an MMB trained on long data traces recorded from links of a deployed network, one can then use samples from the MMB to test different routing algorithms for as long as desired. However, learning an accurate model for a new link requires collecting from it long traces over periods of hours, a costly process in practice (e.g. limited battery life). We propose an algorithm that can adapt a preexisting MMB trained with extensive data to a new link from which very limited data is available. Our approach constrains the new MMB's parameters through a nonlinear transformation of the existing MMB's parameters. The transformation has a small number of parameters that are estimated using a generalized EM algorithm with an inner loop of BFGS iterations. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, and wireless link data from a sensor network. We show we can learn accurate models from data traces of about 1 minute, about 10 times shorter than needed if training an MMB from scratch.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We investigate the problem of mining numerical data with Formal Concept Analysis. The usual way is to use a scaling procedure —transforming numerical attributes into binary ones — leading either to a loss of information or of efficiency, in particular w.r.t. the volume of extracted patterns. By contrast, we propose to directly work on numerical data in a more precise and efficient way. For that, the notions of closed patterns, generators and equivalent classes are revisited in the numerical context. Moreover, two original algorithms are proposed and tested in an evaluation involving real-world data, showing the quality of the present approach.</p>

The central problem is to tell which differences between instances of activities are unimportant and may be safely ignored for the purpose of learning generalized representations of activities. We develop a novel way to find the "essential parts" of activities by a greedy kind of multiple sequence alignment, and a method to transform the resulting alignments into Finite State Machine that will accept novel instances of activities with high accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) unsupervised learning framework extracts features representing the underlying causes of the changes within a temporally coherent high-dimensional raw sensory input signal. We develop the first online version of SFA, via a combination of incremental Principal Components Analysis and Minor Components Analysis. Unlike standard batch-based SFA, online SFA adapts along with non-stationary environments, which makes it a generally useful unsupervised preprocessor for autonomous learning agents. We compare online SFA to batch SFA in several experiments and show that it indeed learns without a teacher to encode the input stream by informative slow features representing meaningful abstract environmental properties. We extend online SFA to deep networks in hierarchical fashion, and use them to successfully extract abstract object position information from high-dimensional video.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many applications in Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access involve searching large databases of high dimensional data objects with multiple (conditionally independent) views. In this work we consider the problem of learning hash functions for similarity search across the views for such applications. We propose a principled method for learning a hash function for each view given a set of multiview training data objects. The hash functions map similar objects to similar codes across the views thus enabling cross-view similarity search. We present results from an extensive empirical study of the proposed approach which demonstrate its effectiveness on Japanese language People Search and Multilingual People Search problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Network community detection — the problem of dividing a network of interest into clusters for intelligent analysis — has recently attracted significant attention in diverse fields of research. To discover intrinsic community structure a quantitative measure called modularity has been widely adopted as an optimization objective. Unfortunately, modularity is inherently NP-hard to optimize and approximate solutions must be sought if tractability is to be ensured. In practice, a spectral relaxation method is most often adopted, after which a community partition is recovered from relaxed fractional values by a rounding process. In this paper, we propose an iterative rounding strategy for identifying the partition decisions that is coupled with a fast constrained power method that sequentially achieves tighter spectral relaxations. Extensive evaluation with this coupled relaxation-rounding method demonstrates consistent and sometimes dramatic improvements in the modularity of the communities discovered.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most of the existing probit classifiers are based on sparsity-oriented modeling. However, we show that sparsity is not always desirable in practice, and only an appropriate degree of sparsity is profitable. In this work, we propose a flexible probabilistic model using a generalized Gaussian scale mixture prior that can promote an appropriate degree of sparsity for its model parameters, and yield either sparse or non-sparse estimates according to the intrinsic sparsity of features in a dataset. Model learning is carried out by an efficient modified maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. We also show relationships of the proposed model to existing probit classifiers as well as iteratively re-weighted l1 and l2 minimizations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has better or comparable performances in feature selection for linear classifiers as well as in kernel-based classification.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Matrix factorization based techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and concept factorization (CF), have attracted great attention in dimension reduction and data clustering. Both of them are linear learning problems and lead to a sparse representation of the data. However, the sparsity obtained by these methods does not always satisfy locality conditions, thus the obtained data representation is not the best. This paper introduces a locality-constrained concept factorization method which imposes a locality constraint onto the traditional concept factorization. By requiring the concepts (basis vectors) to be as close to the original data points as possible, each data can be represented by a linear combination of only a few basis concepts. Thus our method is able to achieve sparsity and locality at the same time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel algorithm through a set of evaluations on real world applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a new clustering based low-rank matrix approximation method, Cluster Indicator Decomposition (CID), which yields more accurate low-rank approximations than previous commonly used singular value decomposition and other Nyström style decompositions. Our model utilizes the intrinsic structures of data and theoretically be more compact and accurate than the traditional low rank approximation approaches. The reconstruction in CID is extremely fast leading to a desirable advantage of our method in large-scale kernel machines (like Support Vector Machines) in which the reconstruction of the kernels needs to be frequently computed. Experimental results indicate that our approach compress images much more efficiently than other factorization based methods. We show that combining our method with Support Vector Machines obtains more accurate approximation and more accurate prediction while consuming much less computation resources.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose the new Ball Ranking Machines (BRMs) to address the supervised ranking problems. In previous work, supervised ranking methods have been successfully applied in various information retrieval tasks. Among these methodologies, the Ranking Support Vector Machines (Rank SVMs) are well investigated. However, one major fact limiting their applications is that Ranking SVMs need optimize a margin-based objective function over all possible document pairs within all queries on the training set. In consequence, Ranking SVMs need select a large number of support vectors among a huge number of support vector candidates. This paper introduces a new model of of Ranking SVMs and develops an efficient approximation algorithm, which decreases the training time and generates much fewer support vectors. Empirical studies on synthetic data and content-based image/video retrieval data show that our method is comparable to Ranking SVMs in accuracy, but use much fewer ranking support vectors and significantly less training time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Ensemble learning with output from multiple supervised and unsupervised models aims to improvethe classification accuracy of supervised model ensembleby jointly considering the grouping results from unsupervised models. In this paper we cast this ensemble task as an unconstrained probabilistic embedding problem. Specifically, we assume both objects and classes/clusters have latent coordinates without constraints in a D-dimensional Euclidean space, and consider the mapping from the embedded space into the space of results from supervised and unsupervised models as a probabilistic generative process. The prediction of an objectis then determined by the distances between the objectand the classes in the embedded space. A solution of this embedding can be obtained using the quasi-Newton method, resulting in the objects and classes/clusters with high co-occurrence weights being embedded close. We demonstrate the benefits of this unconstrained embedding method by three real applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Monitoring team activity is beneficial when human teams cooperate in the enactment of a joint plan. Monitoring allows teams to maintain awareness of each other's progress within the plan and it enables anticipation of information needs. Humans find this difficult, particularly in time-stressed and uncertain environments. In this paper we introduce a probabilistic model, based on Conditional Random Fields, to automatically recognise the composition of teams and the team activities in relation to a plan. The team composition and activities are recognised incrementally by interpreting a stream of spatio-temporal observations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-task learning remains a difficult yet important problem in machine learning. In Gaussian processes the main challenge is the definition of valid kernels (covariance functions) able to capture the relationships between different tasks. This paper presents a novel methodology to construct valid multi-task covariance functions (Mercer kernels) for Gaussian processes allowing for a combination of kernels with different forms. The method is based on Fourier analysis and is general for arbitrary stationary covariance functions. Analytical solutions for cross covariance terms between popular forms are provided including Mat´ern, squared exponential and sparse covariance functions. Experiments are conducted with both artificial and real datasets demonstrating the benefits of the approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Imitation learning refers to the problem of learning how to behave by observinga teacher in action. We consider imitation learning in relational domains, in which there is a varying number of objects and relations among them. In prior work, simple relational policies are learned by viewing imitation learning as supervised learning of a function from states to actions. For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several different domains.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many real-world applications of the time series classification problem, not only could the negative training instances be missing, the number of positive instances available for learning may also be rather limited. This has motivated the development of new classification algorithms that can learn from a small set P of labeled seed positive instances augmented with a set U of unlabeled instances (i.e. PU learning algorithms). However, existing PU learning algorithms for time series classification have less than satisfactory performance as they are unable to identify the class boundary between positive and negative instances accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel PU learning algorithm LCLC (Learning from Common Local Clusters) for time series classification. LCLC is designed to effectively identify the ground truths’ positive and negative boundaries, resulting in more accurate classifiers than those constructed using existing methods. We have applied LCLC to classify time series data from different application domains; the experimental results demonstrate that LCLC outperforms existing methods significantly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a family of Passive-Aggressive Mahalanobis (PAM) algorithms, which are incremental (online) binary classifiers that consider the distribution of data. PAM is in fact a generalization of the Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithms to handle data distributions that can be represented by a covariance matrix. The update equations for PAM are derived and theoretical error loss bounds computed. We benchmarked PAM against the original PA-I, PA-II, and Confidence Weighted (CW) learning. Although PAM somewhat resembles CW in its update equations, PA minimizes differences in the weights while CW minimizes differences in weight distributions. Results on 8 classification datasets, which include a real-life micro-blog sentiment classification task, show that PAM consistently outperformed its competitors, most notably CW. This shows that a simple approach like PAM is more practical in real-life classification tasks, compared to more elegant and sophisticated approaches like CW.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important methods to handle high-dimensional data. However, the high computa-tional complexity makes it hard to apply to the large scale data with high dimensionality, and the used 2-norm makes it sensitive to outliers. A recent work proposed principal component analysis based on 1-norm maximization, which is efficient and robust to outliers. In that work, a greedy strategy was applied due to the difficulty of directly solving the 1-norm maximization problem, which is easy to get stuck in local solution. In this paper, we first propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve a general 1-norm maximization problem, and then propose a robust principal component analysis with non-greedy 1-norm maximization. Experimental results on real world datasets show that the non-greedy method always obtains much better solution than that of the greedy method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Distributed electricity producers, such as small wind farms and solar installations, pose several technical and economic challenges in Smart Grid design. One approach to addressing these challenges is through Broker Agents who buy electricity from distributed producers, and also sell electricity to consumers, via a Tariff Market--a new market mechanism where Broker Agents publish concurrent bid and ask prices. We investigate the learning of pricing strategies for an autonomous Broker Agent to profitably participate in a Tariff Market. We employ Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning. An important concern with this method is that even simple representations of the problem domain result in very large numbers of states in the MDP formulation because market prices can take nearly arbitrary real values. In this paper, we present the use of derived state space features, computed using statistics on Tariff Market prices and Broker Agent customer portfolios, to obtain a scalable state representation. We also contribute a set of pricing tactics that form building blocks in the learned Broker Agent strategy. We further present a Tariff Market simulation model based on real-world data and anticipated market dynamics. We use this model to obtain experimental results that show the learned strategy performing vastly better than a random strategy and significantly better than two other non-learning strategies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper introduces a novel multi-modular method for reinforcement learning.A multi-modular system is one that partitions the learning task among a set of experts (modules), where each expert is incapable of solving the entire task by itself.There are many advantages to splitting up large tasks in this way, but existing methods face difficulties when choosing which module(s) should contribute to the agent's actions at any particular moment.We introduce a novel selection mechanism where every module, besides calculating a set of action values, also estimates its own error for the current input.The selection mechanism combines each module's estimate of long-term reward and self-error to produce a score by which the next module is chosen.As a result, the modules can use their resources effectively and efficiently divide up the task.The system is shown to learn complex tasks even when the individual modules use only linear function approximators.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a novel approach for domain adaptation based on feature grouping and re-weighting. Our algorithm operates by creating an ensemble of multiple classifiers, where each classifier is trained on one particular feature group. Faced with the distribution change involved in domain change, different feature groups exhibit different cross-domain prediction abilities. Herein, ensemble models provide us the flexibility of tuning the weights of corresponding classifiers in order to adapt to the new domain. Our approach is supported by a solid theoretical analysis based on the expressiveness of ensemble classifiers, which allows trading-off errors across source and target domains. Moreover, experimental results on sentiment classification and spam detection show that our approach not only outperforms the baseline method, but is also superior to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Continuous time series data often comprise or contain repeated motifs — patterns that have similar shape, and yet exhibit nontrivial variability. Identifying these motifs, even in the presence of variation, is an important subtask in both unsupervised knowledge discovery and constructing useful features for discriminative tasks. This paper addresses this task using a probabilistic framework that models generation of data as switching between a random walk state and states that generate motifs. A motif is generated from a continuous shape template that can undergo non-linear transformations such as temporal warping and additive noise. We propose an unsupervised algorithm that simultaneously discovers both the set of canonical shape templates and a template-specific model of variability manifested in the data. Experimental results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our model is able to recover templates in data where repeated instances show large variability. The recovered templates provide higher classification accuracy and coverage when compared to those from alternatives such as random projection based methods and simpler generative models that do not model variability. Moreover, in analyzing physiological signals from infants in the ICU, we discover both known signatures as well as novel physiomarkers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a general MCMC method for Bayesian inference in logic-based probabilistic modeling. It covers a broad class of generative models including Bayesian networks and PCFGs. The idea is to generalize an MCMC method for PCFGs to the one for a Turing-complete probabilistic modeling language PRISM in the context of statistical abduction where parse trees are replaced with explanations. We describe how to estimate the marginal probability of data from MCMC samples and how to perform Bayesian Viterbi inference using an example of Naive Bayes model augmented with a hidden variable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Understanding extreme events, such as hurricanes or forest fires, is of paramount importance because of their adverse impacts on human beings. Such events often propagate in space and time. Predicting-even a few days in advance-what locations will get affected by the event tracks could benefit our society in many ways. Arguably, simulations from “first principles,” where underlying physics-based models are described by a system of equations, provide least reliable predictions for variables characterizing the dynamics of these extreme events. Data-driven model building has been recently emerging as a complementary approach that could learn the relationships between historically observed or simulated multiple, spatio-temporal ancillary variables and the dynamic behavior of extreme events of interest. While promising, the methodology for predictive learning from such complex data is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a dynamic networks-based methodology for in-advance prediction of the dynamic tracks of emerging extreme events. By associating a network model of the system with the known tracks, our method is capable of learning the recurrent network motifs that could be used as discriminatory signatures for the event's behavioral class. When applied to classifying the behavior of the hurricane tracks at their early formation stages in Western Africa region, our method is able to predict whether hurricane tracks will hit the land of the North Atlantic region at least 10-15 days lead lag time in advance with more than 90% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation. To the best of our knowledge, no comparable methodology exists for solving this problem using data-driven models.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Opinion leaders play an important role in influencing people’s beliefs, actions and behaviors. Although a number of methods have been proposed for identifying influentials using secondary sources of information, the use of primary sources, such as surveys, is still favored in many domains. In this work we present a new surveying method which combines secondary data with partial knowledge from primary sources to guide the information gathering process. We apply our proposed active surveying method to the problem of identifying key opinion leaders in the medical field, and show how we are able to accurately identify the opinion leaders while minimizing the amount of primary data required, which results in significant cost reduction in data acquisition without sacrificing its integrity.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consistency-based feature selection is an important category of feature selection research yet is defined only intuitively in the literature. First, we formally define a consistency measure, and then using this definition, evaluate 19 feature selection measures from the literature. While only 5 of these were labeledas consistency measures by their original authors, by our definition, an additional 9 measures should be classified as consistency measures. To compare these 14 consistency measures in terms of sensitivity, we introduce the concept of quasilinear compatibility order, and partially determine the order among the measures. Next, we proposea new fast algorithm for consistency-based feature selection. We ran experiments using eleven large datasets to compare the performance of our algorithm against INTERACT and LCC, the only two instances of consistency-based algorithms with potential real world application. Our algorithm shows vast improvement in time efficiency, while its performance in accuracy is comparable with that of INTERACT and LCC.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose an online classification approach for co-occurrence data which is based on a simple information theoretic principle. We further show how to properly estimate the uncertainty associated with each prediction of our scheme and demonstrate how to exploit these uncertainty estimates. First, in order to abstain highly uncertain predictions. And second, within an active learning framework, in order to preserve classification accuracy while substantially reducing training set size. Our method is highly efficient in terms of run-time and memory footprint requirements. Experimental results in the domain of text classification demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our method is superior or comparable to other state-of-the-art online classification algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Dimensionality reduction plays a vital role in pattern recognition. However, for normalized vector data, existing methods do not utilize the fact that the data is normalized. In this paper, we propose to employ an Angular Decomposition of the normalized vector data which corresponds to embedding them on a unit surface. On graph data for similarity/kernel matrices with constant diagonal elements, we propose the Angular Decomposition of the similarity matrices which corresponds to embedding objects on a unit sphere. In these angular embeddings, the Euclidean distance is equivalent to the cosine similarity. Thus data structures best described in the cosine similarity and data structures best captured by the Euclidean distance can both be effectively detected in our angular embedding. We provide the theoretical analysis, derive the computational algorithm, and evaluate the angular embedding on several datasets. Experiments on data clustering demonstrate that our method can provide a more discriminative subspace.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper introduces Streaming Half-Space-Trees (HS-Trees), a fast one-class anomaly detector for evolving data streams. It requires only normal data for training and works well when anomalous data are rare. The model features an ensemble of random HS-Trees, and the tree structure is constructed without any data. This makes the method highly efficient because it requires no model restructuring when adapting to evolving data streams. Our analysis shows that Streaming HS-Trees has constant amortised time complexity and constant memory requirement. When compared with a state-of-the-art method, our method performs favourably in terms of detection accuracy and runtime performance. Our experimental results also show that the detection performance of Streaming HS-Trees is not sensitive to its parameter settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Fraud detection is a key activity with serious socio-economical impact. Inspection activities associated with this task are usually constrained by limited available resources. Data analysis methods can provide help in the task of deciding where to allocate these limited resources in order to optimise the outcome of the inspection activities. This paper presents a multi-strategy learning method to address the question of which cases to inspect first. The proposed methodology is based on the utility theory and provides a ranking ordered by decreasing expected outcome of inspecting the candidate cases. This outcome is a function not only of the probability of the case being fraudulent but also of the inspection costs and expected payoff if the case is confirmed as a fraud. The proposed methodology is general and can be useful on fraud detection activities with limited inspection resources. We experimentally evaluate our proposal on both an artificial domain and on a real world task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We advocate the use of an explicit time representation in syntactic pattern recognition because it can result in more succinct models and easier learning problems. We apply this approach to the real-world problem of learning models for the driving behavior of truck drivers. We discretize the values of onboard sensors into simple events. Instead of the common syntactic pattern recognition approach of sampling the signal values at a fixed rate, we model the time constraints using timed models. We learn these models using the RTI+ algorithm from grammatical inference, and show how to use computational mechanics and a form of semi-supervised classification to construct a real-time automaton classifier for driving behavior. Promising results are shown using this new approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Text classification is widely used in many real-world applications. To obtain satisfied classification performance, most traditional data mining methods require lots of labeled data, which can be costly in terms of both time and human efforts. In reality, there are plenty of such resources in English since it has the largest population in the Internet world, which is not true in many other languages. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning approach to tackle the cross-language text classification problems. We first align the feature spaces in both domains utilizing some on-line translation service, which makes the two feature spaces under the same coordinate. Although the feature sets in both domains are the same, the distributions of the instances in both domains are different, which violates the i.i.d. assumption in most traditional machine learning methods. For this issue, we propose an iterative feature and instance weighting (Bi-Weighting) method for domain adaptation. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms some baselines including four transfer learning algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a manifold alignment based approach for heterogeneous domain adaptation. A key aspect of this approach is to construct mappings to link different feature spaces in order to transfer knowledge across domains. The new approach can reuse labeled data from multiple source domains in a target domain even in the case when the input domains do not share any common features or instances. As a pre-processing step, our approach can also be combined with existing domain adaptation approaches to learn a common feature space for all input domains. This paper extends existing manifold alignment approaches by making use of labels rather than correspondences to align the manifolds. This extension significantly broadens the application scope of manifold alignment, since the correspondence relationship required by existing alignment approaches is hard to obtain in many applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper describes a novel framework to jointly learn data-dependent label and locality-preserving projections. Given a set of data instances from multiple classes, the proposed approach can automatically learn which classes are more similar to each other, and construct discriminative features using both labeled and unlabeled data to map similar classes to similar locations in a lower dimensional space. In contrast to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and its variants, which can only return c-1 features for a problem with c classes, the proposed approach can generate d features, where d is bounded only by the number of the input features. We describe and evaluate the new approach both theoretically and experimentally, and compare its performance with other state of the art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
NonnegativeMatrix Factorization (NMF) based coclustering methods have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their mathematical elegance and encouraging empirical results. However, the algorithms to solve NMF problems usually involve intensive matrix multiplications, which make them computationally inefficient. In this paper, instead of constraining the factor matrices of NMF to be nonnegative as existing methods, we propose a novel Fast Nonnegative Matrix Trifactorization (FNMTF) approach to constrain them to be cluster indicator matrices, a special type of nonnegative matrices. As a result, the optimization problem of our approach can be decoupled, which results in much smaller size subproblems requiring much less matrix multiplications, such that our approach works well for large-scale input data. Moreover, the resulted factor matrices can directly assign cluster labels to data points and features due to the nature of indicator matrices. In addition, through exploiting the manifold structures in both data and feature spaces, we further introduce the Locality Preserved FNMTF (LP-FNMTF) approach, by which the clustering performance is improved. The promising results in extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Data sets containing multi-manifold structures are ubiquitous in real-world tasks, and effective grouping of such data is an important yet challenging problem. Though there were many studies on this problem, it is not clear on how to design principled methods for the grouping of multiple hybrid manifolds. In this paper, we show that spectral methods are potentially helpful for hybridmanifold clustering when the neighborhood graph is constructed to connect the neighboring samples from the same manifold. However, traditional algorithms which identify neighbors according to Euclidean distance will easily connect samples belonging to different manifolds. To handle this drawback, we propose a new criterion, i.e., local and structural consistency criterion, which considers the neighboring information as well as the structural information implied by the samples. Based on this criterion, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm, named Local and Structural Consistency (LSC), for clustering with multiple hybrid manifolds. Experiments show that LSC achieves promising performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the problem of learning to act in partially observable, continuous-state-and-action worlds where we have abstract prior knowledge about the structure of the optimal policy in the form of a distribution over policies. Using ideas from planning-as-inference reductions and Bayesian unsupervised learning, we cast Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a stochastic, hill-climbing policy search algorithm. Importantly, this algorithm's search bias is directly tied to the prior and its MCMC proposal kernels, which means we can draw on the full Bayesian toolbox to express the search bias, including nonparametric priors and structured, recursive processes like grammars over action sequences. Furthermore, we can reason about uncertainty in the search bias itself by constructing a hierarchical prior and reasoning about latent variables that determine the abstract structure of the policy. This yields an adaptive search algorithm---our algorithm learns to learn a structured policy efficiently. We show how inference over the latent variables in these policy priors enables intra- and intertask transfer of abstract knowledge. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by learning meta search biases, by constructing a nonparametric finite state controller to model memory, by discovering motor primitives using a simple grammar over primitive actions, and by combining all three.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning to rank has received great attention in recent years as it plays a crucial role in information retrieval. The existing concept of learning to rank assumes that each training sample is associated with an instance and a reliable label. However, in practice, this assumption does not necessarily hold true. This study focuses on the learning to rank when each training instance is labeled by multiple annotators that may be unreliable. In such a scenario, no accurate labels can be obtained. This study proposes two learning approaches. One is to simply estimate the ground truth first and then to learn a ranking model with it. The second approach is a maximum likelihood learning approach which estimates the ground truth and learns the ranking model iteratively. The two approaches have been tested on both synthetic and real-world data. The results reveal that the maximum likelihood approach outperforms the first approach significantly and is comparable of achieving results with the learning model considering reliable labels. Further more, both the approaches have been applied for ranking the Web visual clutter.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Positive and unlabelled learning (PU learning) has been investigated to deal with the situation where only the positive examples and the unlabelled examples are available. Most of the previous works focus on identifying some negative examples from the unlabelled data, so that the supervised learning methods can be applied to build a classifier. However, for the remaining unlabelled data, which can not be explicitly identified as positive or negative (we call them ambiguous examples), they either exclude them from the training phase or simply enforce them to either class. Consequently, their performance may be constrained. This paper proposes a novel approach, called similarity-based PU learning (SPUL) method, by associating the ambiguous examples with two similarity weights, which indicate the similarity of an ambiguous example towards the positive class and the negative class, respectively. The local similarity-based and global similarity-based mechanisms are proposed to generate the similarity weights. The ambiguous examples and their similarity-weights are thereafter incorporated into an SVM-based learning phase to build a more accurate classifier. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have shown that SPUL outperforms state-of-the-art PU learning methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Data streams containing objects that are (or can be) associated with more than one label at the same time are ubiquitous. In spite of its important applications, classification of streaming multi-label data is largely unexplored. Existing approaches try to tackle the problem by transferring traditional single-label stream classification practices to the multi-label domain. Nevertheless, they fail to consider some of the unique properties of the problem such as within and between class imbalance and multiple concept drift. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-label stream classification approach that employs two windows for each label, one for positive and one for negative examples. Instance-sharing is exploited for space efficiency, while a time-efficient instantiation based on the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is also proposed. Finally, a batch-incremental thresholding technique is proposed to further deal with the class imbalance problem. Results of an empirical comparison against two other methods on three real world datasets are in favor of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Compared with supervised learning for feature selection, it is much more difficult to select the discriminative features in unsupervised learning due to the lack of label information. Traditional unsupervised feature selection algorithms usually select the features which best preserve the data distribution, e.g., manifold structure, of the whole feature set. Under the assumption that the class label of input data can be predicted by a linear classifier, we incorporate discriminative analysis and `2;1-norm minimization into a joint framework for unsupervised feature selection. Different from existing unsupervised feature selection algorithms, our algorithm selects the most discriminative feature subset from the whole feature set in batch mode. Extensive experiment on different data types demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we address the problem of matrix factorization on compressively-sampled measurements which are obtained by random projections. While this approach improves the scalability of matrix factorization, its performance is not satisfactory. We present a matrix co-factorization method where compressed measurements and a small number of uncompressed measurements are jointly decomposed, sharing a factor matrix. We evaluate the performance of three matrix factorization methods in terms of Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds, including: (1) matrix factorization on uncompressed data (MF); (2) matrix factorization on compressed data (CS-MF); (3) matrix co-factorization on compressed and uncompressed data (CS-MCF). Numerical experiments demonstrate that CS-MCF improves the performance of CS-MF, emphasizing the useful behavior of exploiting side information (a small number of uncompressed measurements).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Ensemble methods, which train multiple learners for a task, are among the state-of-the-art learning approaches. The diversity of the component learners has been recognized as a key to a good ensemble, and existing ensemble methods try different ways to encourage diversity, mostly by heuristics. In this paper, we propose the diversity regularized machine (DRM) in a mathematical programming framework, which efficiently generates an ensemble of diverse support vector machines (SVMs). Theoretical analysis discloses that the diversity constraint used in DRM can lead to an effective reduction on its hypothesis space complexity, implying that the diversity control in ensemble methods indeed plays a role of regularization as in popular statistical learning approaches. Experiments show that DRM can significantly improve generalization ability and is superior to some state-of-the-art SVM ensemble methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-label learning deals with the problem where each training example is represented by a single instance while associated with a set of class labels. For an unseen example, existing approaches choose to determine the membership of each possible class label to it based on identical feature set, i.e. the very instance representation of the unseen example is employed in the discrimination processes of all labels. However, this commonly-used strategy might be suboptimal as different class labels usually carry specific characteristics of their own, and it could be beneficial to exploit different feature sets for the discrimination of different labels. Based on the above reflection, we propose a new strategy to multi-label learning by leveraging label-specific features, where a simple yet effective algorithm named LIFT is presented. Briefly, LIFT constructs features specific to each label by conducting clustering analysis on its positive and negative instances, and then performs training and testing by querying the clustering results. Extensive experiments across sixteen diversified data sets clearly validate the superiority of LIFT against other well-established multi-label learning algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, a novel method is developed for enabling Multi-Kernel Multi-Label Learning. Inter-label dependency and similarity diversity are simultaneously leveraged in the proposed method. A concept network is constructed to capture the inter-label correlations for classifier training. Maximal margin approach is used to effectively formulate the feature-label associations and the label-label correlations. Specific kernels are learned not only for each label but also for each pair of the inter-related labels. By learning the eigenfunctions of the kernels, the similarity between a new data point and the training samples can be computed in the online mode. Our experimental results on real datasets (web pages, images, music, and bioinformatics) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Field classification is an extension of the traditional classification framework, by breaking the i.i.d. assumption. In field classification, patterns occur as groups (fields) of homogeneous styles. By utilizing style consistency, classifying groups of patterns is often more accurate than classifying single patterns. In this paper, we extend the Bayes decision theory, and develop the Field Bayesian Model (FBM) to deal with field classification. Specifically, we propose to learn a Style Normalized Transformation (SNT) for each field. Via the SNTs, the data of different fields are transformed to a uniform style space (i.i.d. space). The proposed model is a general and systematic framework, under which many probabilistic models can be easily extended for field classification. To transfer the model to unseen styles, we propose a transductive model called Transfer Bayesian Rule (TBR) based on self-training. We conducted extensive experiments on face, speech and a large-scale handwriting dataset, and got significant error rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consider a video surveillance application that monitors some location. The application knows a set of activity models (that are either normal or abnormal or both), but in addition, the application wants to find video segments that are unexplained by any of the known activity models — these unexplained video segments may correspond to activities for which no previous activity model existed. In this paper, we formally define what it means for a given video segment to be unexplained (totally or partially) w.r.t. a given set of activity models and a probability threshold. We develop two algorithms – FindTUA and FindPUA – to identify Totally and Partially Unexplained Activities respectively, and show that both algorithms use important pruning methods. We report on experiments with a prototype implementation showing that the algorithms both run efficiently and are accurate.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Cost-Based Abduction (CBA) is an AI model for reasoning under uncertainty. In CBA, evidence to be explained is treated as a goal which is true and must be proven. Each proof of the goal is viewed as a feasible explanation and has a cost equal to the sum of the costs of all hypotheses that are assumed to complete the proof. The aim is to find the Least Cost Proof. This paper uses CBA to develop a novel method for modeling Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRN) and explaining genetic knock-out effects. Constructing GRN using multiple data sources is a fundamental problem in computational biology. We show that CBA is a powerful formalism for modeling GRN that can easily and effectively integrate multiple sources of biological data. In this paper, we use three different biological data sources: Protein-DNA, Protein–Protein and gene knock-out data. Using this data, we first create an un-annotated graph; CBA then annotates the graph by assigning a sign and a direction to each edge. Our biological results are promising; however, this manuscript focuses on the mathematical modeling of the application. The advantages of CBA and its relation to Bayesian inference are also presented.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
How obliged can we be to AI, and how much danger does it pose us? A surprising proportion of our society holds exaggerated fears or hopes for AI, such as the fear of robot world conquest, or the hope that AI will indefinitely perpetuate our culture. These misapprehensions are symptomatic of a larger problem—a confusion about the nature and origins of ethics and its role in society. While AI technologies do pose promises and threats, these are not qualitatively different from those posed by other artifacts of our culture which are largely ignored: from factories to advertising, weapons to political systems. Ethical systems are based on notions of identity, and the exaggerated hopes and fears of AI derive from our cultures having not yet accommodated the fact that language and reasoning are no longer uniquely human. The experience of AI may improve our ethical intuitions and self-understanding, potentially helping our societies make better-informed decisions on serious ethical dilemmas.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow a user to directly control devices such as cursors and robots using brain signals. Non-invasive BCIs, e.g., those based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from the scalp, suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio which limits the bandwidth of control. Invasive BCIs allow fine-grained control but can leave users exhausted since control is typically exerted on a moment-by-moment basis. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a new adaptive hierarchical architecture for brain-computer interfacing. The approach allows a user to teach the BCI new skills on-the-fly; these learned skills are later invoked directly as high-level commands, relieving the user of tedious low-level control. We report results from four subjects who used a hierarchical EEG-based BCI to successfully train and control a humanoid robot in a virtual home environment. Gaussian processes were used for learning high-level commands, allowing a BCI to switch between autonomous and user-guided modes based on the current estimate of uncertainty. We also report the first instance of multi-tasking in a BCI, involving simultaneous control of two different devices by a single user. Our results suggest that hierarchical BCIs can provide a flexible and robust way of controlling complex robotic devices in real-world environments.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In real-world applications, the effective integration of learning and reasoning in a cognitive agent model is a difficult task. However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and construction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, controlled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In particular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abilities have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such relationships by hand. We introduce a novel cognitive agent model and architecture for online learning and reasoning that seeks to effectively represent, learn and reason in complex training environments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hypotheses from observed data, and infer new beliefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a Bayesian inference model. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenarios, with possible applications in a range of areas.</p>

We report the results obtained during the verification of Autosub6000, an autonomous underwater vehicle used for deep oceanic exploration. Our starting point is the Simulink/Matlab engineering model of the submarine, which is discretised by a compiler into a representation suitable for model checking. We assess the ability of the vehicle to function under degraded conditions by injecting faults automatically into the discretised model. The resulting system is analysed by means of the model checker MCMAS, and conclusions are drawn on the system's ability to withstand faults and to perform self-diagnosis and recovery. We present lessons learnt from this and suggest a general method for verifying autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Occlusions are a central phenomenon in multi-object computer vision. However, formal analyses (LOS14, ROC20) proposed in the spatial reasoning literature ignore many distinctions crucial to computer vision, as a result of which these algebras have been largely ignored in vision applications. Two distinctions of relevance to visual computation are (a) whether the occluder is a moving object or part of the static background, and (b) whether the visible part of an object is a connected blob or fragmented. In this work, we develop a formal model of occlusion states that combines these criteria with overlap distinctions modeled in spatial reasoning to come up with a comprehensive set of fourteen occlusion states, which we define as OCS14. Transitions between these occlusion states are an important source of information on visual activity (e.g. splits and merges). We show that the resulting formalism is representationally complete in the sense that these states constitute a partition of all possible occlusion situations based on these criteria. Finally, we show results from implementations of this approach in a test application involving static camera based scene analysis, where occlusion state analysis and multiple object tracking can be used for two tasks -- (a) identifying static occluders, and (b) modeling a class of interactions represented as transitions of occlusion states. Thus, the formalism is shown to have direct relevance to actual vision applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
During the design of a microprocessor, Design Space Exploration (DSE) is a critical step which determines the appropriate design configuration of the microprocessor. In the computer architecture community, supervised learning techniques have been applied to DSE to build models for predicting the qualities of design configurations. For supervised learning, however, considerable simulation costs are required for attaining the labeled design configurations. Given limited resources, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, inspired by recent advances in semi-supervised learning, we propose the COMT approach which can exploit unlabeled design configurations to improve the models. In addition to an improved predictive accuracy, COMT is able to guide the design of microprocessors, owing to the use of comprehensible model trees. Empirical study demonstrates that COMT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DSE technique through reducing mean squared error by 30% to 84%, and thus, promising architectures can be attained more efficiently.</p>

It has been known for a long time that visual task, such as reading, counting and searching, greatly influences eye movement patterns. Perhaps the best known demonstration of this is the celebrated study of Yarbus showing that different eye movement trajectories emerge depending on the visual task that the viewers are given. The objective of this paper is to develop an inverse Yarbus process whereby we can infer the visual task by observing the measurements of a viewer’s eye movements while executing the visual task. The method we are proposing is to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to create a probabilistic framework to infer the viewer’s task from eye movements.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given its ubiquity, scale and complexity, few problems have created the combined interest of so many unrelated areas as the evolution of cooperation. Using the tools of evolutionary game theory, here we address, for the first time, the role played by intention recognition in the final outcome of cooperation in large populations of self-regarding individuals. By equipping individuals with the capacity of assessing intentions of others in the course of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma interactions, we show how intention recognition opens a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive, as it precludes the invasion of pure cooperators by random drift while remaining robust against defective strategies. Intention recognizers are able to assign an intention to the action of their opponents based on an acquired corpus of possible intentions. We show how intention recognizers can prevail against most famous strategies of repeated dilemmas of cooperation, even in the presence of errors. Our approach invites the adoption of other classification and pattern recognition mechanisms common among Humans, to unveil the evolution of complex cognitive processes in the context of social dilemmas.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Faceted navigation can effectively reduce user efforts of reaching targeted resources in databases, by suggesting dynamic facet values for iterative query refinement. A key issue is minimizing the navigation cost in a user query session. Conventional navigation scheme assumes that at each step, users select only one suggested value to figure out resources containing it. To make faceted navigation more flexible and effective, this paper introduces a multi-select scheme where multiple suggested values can be selected at one step, and a selected value can be used to either retain or exclude the resources containing it. Previous algorithms for cost-driven value suggestion can hardly work well under our navigation scheme. Therefore, we propose to optimize the navigation cost using the Minimum Description Length principle, which can well balance the number of navigation steps and the number of suggested values per step under our new scheme. An emperical study demonstrates that our approach is more cost-saving and efficient than state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In order for agents to be able to act intelligently in an environment, a first necessary step is to become aware of the current situation in the environment. Forming such awareness is not a trivial matter. Appropriate observations should be selected by the agent, and the observation results should be interpreted and combined into one coherent picture. Humans use dedicated mental models which represent the relationships between various observations and the formation of beliefs about the environment, which then again direct the further observations to be performed. In this paper, a generic agent model for situation awareness is proposed that is able to take a mental model as input, and utilize this model to create a picture of the current situation. In order to show the suitability of the approach, it has been applied within the domain of F-16 fighter pilot training for which a dedicated mental model has been specified, and simulations experiments have been conducted.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Homophily and stochastic equivalence are two primary features of interest in social networks. Recently, the multiplicative latent factor model (MLFM) is proposed to model social networks with directed links. Although MLFM can capture stochastic equivalence, it cannot model well homophily in networks. However, many real-world networks exhibit homophily or both homophily and stochastic equivalence, and hence the network structure of these networks cannot be modeled well by MLFM. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called generalized latent factor model (GLFM), for social network analysis by enhancing homophily modeling in MLFM. We devise a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm with linear-time complexity and convergence guarantee to learn the model parameters. Extensive experiments on some real-world networks show that GLFM can effectively model homophily to dramatically outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Prediction models for multivariate spatio-temporal functions in geosciences are typically developed using supervised learning from attributes collected by remote sensing instruments collocated with the outcome variable provided at sparsely located sites. In such collocated data there are often large temporal gaps due to missing attribute values at sites where outcome labels are available. Our objective is to develop more accurate spatio-temporal predictors by using enlarged collocated data obtained by imputing missing attributes at time and locations where outcome labels are available. The proposed method for large gaps estimation in space and time (called LarGEST) exploits temporal correlation of attributes, correlations among multiple attributes collected at the same time and space, and spatial correlations among attributes from multiple sites. LarGEST outperformed alternative methods in imputing up to 80% of randomly missing observations at a synthetic spatio-temporal signal and at a model of fluoride content in a water distribution system. LarGEST was also applied for imputing 80% of nonrandom missing values in data from one of the most challenging Earth science problems related to aerosol properties. Using such enlarged data a predictor of aerosol optical depth is developed that was much more accurate than predictors based on alternative imputation methods when tested rigorously over entire continental US in year 2005.</p>

Computational narrative is a complex and interesting domain for exploring AI techniques that algorithmically analyze, understand, and most importantly, generate stories. This paper studies the importance of domain knowledge in story generation, and particularly in analogy-based story generation (ASG). Based on the construct of knowledge container in case-based reasoning, we present a theoretical framework for incorporating domain knowledge in ASG. We complement the framework with empirical results in our existing system Riu.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A human’s ability to diagnose errors, gather data, and generate features in order to build better models is largely untapped. We hypothesize that analyzing results from multiple models can help people diagnose errors by understanding relationships among data, features, and algorithms. These relationships might otherwise be masked by the bias inherent to any individual model. We demonstrate this approach in our Prospect system, show how multiple models can be used to detect label noise and aid in generating new features, and validate our methods in a pair of experiments.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Feature extraction for activity recognition in context-aware ubiquitous computing applications is usually a heuristic process, informed by underlying domain knowledge. Relying on such explicit knowledge is problematic when aiming to generalize across different application domains. We investigate the potential of recent machine learning methods for discovering universal features for context-aware applications of activity recognition. We also describe an alternative data representation based on the empirical cumulative distribution function of the raw data, which effectively abstracts from absolute values. Experiments on accelerometer data from four publicly available activity recognition datasets demonstrate the significant potential of our approach to address both contemporary activity recognition tasks and next generation problems such as skill assessment and the detection of novel activities.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Differences in social responses of individuals can often be related to differences in functioning of neurological mechanisms. This paper presents a cognitive agent model capable of showing different types of social response patterns based on such mechanisms, adopted from theories on mirror neuron systems, emotion regulation, empathy, and autism spectrum disorders. The presented agent model provides a basis for human-like social response patterns of virtual agents in the context of simulation-based training (e.g., for training of therapists), gaming, or for agent-based generation of virtual stories.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The cognitive agent model presented in this paper generates prior and retrospective ownership states for an action based on principles from recent neuro-logical theories. A prior ownership state is affected by prediction of the effects of a prepared action, and exerts control by strengthening or suppressing actual execution of the action. A retrospective ownership state depends on whether the sensed consequences co-occur with the predicted consequences, and is the basis for acknowledging authorship of actions, for example, in social context. It is shown how poor action effect prediction capabilities can lead to reduced retrospective ownership states, as in persons suffering from schizophrenia.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Motivated by applications from computer network security and software engineering, we study the problem of reducing reachability on a graph with unknown edge costs. When the costs are known, reachability reduction can be solved using a linear relaxation of sparsest cut. Problems arise, however, when edge costs are unknown. In this case, blindly applying sparsest cut with incorrect edge costs can result in suboptimal or infeasible solutions. Instead, we propose to solve the problem via edge classification using feedback on individual edges. We show that this approach outperforms competing approaches in accuracy and efficiency on our target applications.</p>

In the aviation safety research domain, cause identification refers to the task of identifying the possible causes responsible for the incident describedin an aviation safety incident report. This task presents a number of challenges, including the scarcity of labeled data and the difficulties in finding the relevant portions of the text. We investigate the use of annotator rationales to overcome these challenges, proposing several new ways of utilizing rationales and showing that through judicious use of the rationales, it is possible to achieve significant improvement over a unigram SVM baseline.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Speakers of many different languages use the Internet. A common activity among these users is uploading images and associating these images with words (in their own language) as captions, filenames, or surrounding text. We use these explicit, monolingual, image-to-word connections to successfully learn implicit, bilingual, word-to-word translations. Bilingual pairs of words are proposed as translations if their corresponding images have similar visual features. We generate bilingual lexicons in 15 language pairs, focusing on words that have been automatically identified as physical objects. The use of visual similarity substantially improves performance over standard approaches based on string similarity: for generated lexicons with 1000 translations, including visual information leads to an absolute improvement in accuracy of 8-12% over string edit distance alone.</p>

Thanks to the idea of social collaboration, Wikipedia has accumulated vast amount of semi-structured knowledge in which the link structure reflects human's cognition on semantic relationship to some extent. In this paper, we proposed a novel method RCRank to jointly compute concept-concept relatedness and concept-category relatedness base on the assumption that information carried in concept-concept links and concept-category links can mutually reinforce each other. Different from previous work, RCRank can not only find semantically related concepts but also interpret their relations by categories. Experimental results on concept recommendation and relation interpretation show that our method substantially outperforms classical methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Understanding the rapidly growing short text is very important. Short text is different from traditional documents in its shortness and sparsity, which hinders the application of conventional machine learning and text mining algorithms. Two major approaches have been exploited to enrich the representation of short text. One is to fetch contextual information of a short text to directly add more text; the other is to derive latent topics from existing large corpus, which are used as features to enrich the representation of short text. The latter approach is elegant and efficient in most cases. The major trend along this direction is to derive latent topics of certain granularity through well-known topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). However, topics of certain granularity are usually not sufficient to set up effective feature spaces. In this paper, we move forward along this direction by proposing an method to leverage topics at multiple granularity, which can model the short text more precisely. Taking short text classification as an example, we compared our proposed method with the state-of-the-art baseline over one open data set. Our method reduced the classification error by 20.25% and 16.68%respectively on two classifiers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A fundamental step in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents. To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? Even assuming children can derive a rough meaning for the sentence from the situation, how do they begin to map this meaning to the structure and the structure to the form of the sentence? In this paper we use feedback from a semantic role labeling (SRL) task to improve the intermediate syntactic representations that feed the SRL. We accomplish this by training an intermediate classifier using signals derived from latent structure optimization techniques. By using a separate classifier to predict internal structure we see benefits due to knowledge embedded in the classifier's feature representation. This extra structure allows the system to begin to learn using weaker, more plausible semantic feedback.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
An elegant approach to learning temporal orderings from texts is to formulate this problem as a constraint optimization problem, which can be then given an exact solution using Integer Linear Programming. This works well for cases where the number of possible relations between temporal entities is restricted to the mere precedence relation [Bramsen et al., 2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008], but becomes impractical when considering all possible interval relations. This paper proposes two innovations, inspired from work on temporal reasoning, that control this combinatorial blow-up, therefore rendering an exact ILP inference viable in the general case. First, we translate our network of constraints from temporal intervals to their endpoints, to handle a drastically smaller set of constraints, while preserving the same temporal information. Second, we show that additional efficiency is gained by enforcing coherence on particular subsets of the entire temporal graphs. We evaluate these innovations through various experiments on TimeBank 1.2, and compare our ILP formulations with various baselines and oracle systems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Machine learning is traditionally formalized and researched as the study of learning concepts and decision functions from labeled examples, requiring a representation that encodes information about the domain of the decision function to be learned. We are interested in providing a way for a human teacher to interact with an automated learner using natural instructions, thus allowing the teacher to communicate the relevant domain expertise to the learner without necessarily knowing anything about the internal representations used in the learning process. In this paper we suggest to view the process of learning a decision function as a natural language lesson interpretation problem instead of learning from labeled examples. This interpretation of machine learning is motivated by human learning processes, in which the learner is given a lesson describing the target concept directly, and a few instances exemplifying it. We introduce a learning algorithm for the lesson interpretation problem that gets feedback from its performance on the final task, while learning jointly (1) how to interpret the lesson and (2) how to use this interpretation to do well on the final task. his approach alleviates the supervision burden of traditional machine learning by focusing on supplying the learner with only human-level task expertise for learning. We evaluate our approach by applying it to the rules of the Freecell solitaire card game. We show that our learning approach can eventually use natural language instructions to learn the target concept and play the game legally. Furthermore, we show that the learned semantic interpreter also generalizes to previously unseen instructions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In order to deal with ambiguity in natural language, it is common to organise words, according to their senses, in synsets, which are groups of synonymous words that can be seen as concepts. The manual creation of a broad-coverage synset base is a time-consuming task, so we take advantage of dictionary definitions for extracting synonymy pairs and clustering for identifying synsets. Since word senses are not discrete, we create fuzzy synsets, where each word has a membership degree. We report on the results of the creation of a fuzzy synset base for Portuguese, from three electronic dictionaries. The resulting resource is larger than existing hancrafted Portuguese thesauri.</p>

We present unsupervised approaches to the problem of modeling dialog acts in asynchronous conversations; i.e., conversations where participants collaborate with each other at different times. In particular, we investigate a graph-theoretic deterministic framework and two probabilistic conversation models (i.e., HMM and HMM+Mix) for modeling dialog acts in emails and forums. We train and test our conversation models on (a) temporal order and (b) graph-structural order of the datasets. Empirical evaluation suggests (i) the graph-theoretic framework that relies on lexical and structural similarity metrics is not the right model for this task, (ii) conversation models perform better on the graph-structural order than the temporal order of the datasets and (iii) HMM+Mix is a better conversation model than the simple HMM model.</p>

Event anaphora resolution plays a critical role in discourse analysis. This paper proposes a tree kernel-based framework for event pronoun resolution. In particular, a new tree expansion scheme is introduced to automatically determine a proper parse tree structure for event pronoun resolution by considering various kinds of competitive information related with the anaphor and the antecedent candidate. Evaluation on the OntoNotes English corpus shows the appropriateness of the tree kernel-based framework and the effectiveness of competitive information for event pronoun resolution.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Among sentiment analysis tasks, review rating prediction is more helpful than binary (positive and negative) classification, especially when the consumers want to compare two good products. Previous work has addressed this problem by extracting various features from the review text for learning a predictor. Since the same word may have different sentiment effects when used by different reviewers on different products, we argue that it is necessary to model such reviewer and product dependent effects in order to predict review ratings more accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to incorporate reviewer and product information into the text based learner for rating prediction. The reviewer, product and text feature are modeled as a three-dimension tensor. The tensor factorization technique is employed to reduce the sparsity and complexity problems. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. We achieve significant improvement as compared with the state of the art methods, especially for the reviews with unpopular products and inactive reviewers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Various semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed recently to solve the long-standing shortage problem of manually labeled data in sentiment classification. However, most existing studies assume the balance between negative and positive samples in both the labeled and unlabeled data, which may not be true in reality. In this paper, we investigate a more common case of semi-supervised learning for imbalanced sentiment classification. In particular, various random subspaces are dynamically generated to deal with the imbalanced class distribution problem. Evaluation across four domains shows the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As tweets has become a comprehensive repository of fresh information, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) for tweets has aroused great research interests because of its center role in a wide range of tweet related studies such as fine-grained information extraction, sentiment analysis and summarization. However, the fact that a tweet is often too short and informal to provide sufficient information poses a main challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new method to collectively label similar tweets. The underlying idea is to exploit similar tweets to make up for the lack of information in a tweet. Specifically, similar tweets are first grouped together by clustering. Then for each cluster a two-stage labeling is conducted: One labeler conducts SRL to get statistical information, such as the predicate/argument/role triples that occur frequently, from its highly confidently labeled results; then in the second stage, another labeler performs SRL with such statistical information to refine the results. Experimental results on a human annotated dataset show that our approach remarkably improves SRL by 3.1% F1.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We argue for an alternative paradigm in evaluating machine translation quality that is strongly empirical but more accurately reflects the utility of translations, by returning to a representational foundation based on AI oriented lexical semantics, rather than the superficial flat n-gram and string representations recently dominating the field. Driven by such metrics as BLEU and WER, current SMT frequently produces unusable translations where the semantic event structure is mistranslated: who did what to whom, when, where, why, and how? We argue that it is time for a new generation of more “intelligent” automatic and semi-automatic metrics, based clearly on getting the structure right at the lexical semantics level. We show empirically that it is possible to use simple PropBank style semantic frame representations to surpass all currently widespread metrics' correlation to human adequacy judgments, including even HTER. We also show that replacing human annotators with automatic semantic role labeling still yields much of the advantage of the approach. We combine the best of both worlds: from an SMT perspective, we provide superior yet low-cost quantitative objective functions for translation quality; and yet from an AI perspective, we regain the representational transparency and clear reflection of semantic utility of structural frame-based knowledge representations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consistent word selection in machine translation is currently realized by resolving word sense ambiguity through the context of a single sentence or neighboring sentences. However, consistent word selection over the whole article has yet to be achieved. Consistency over the whole article is extremely important when applying machine translation to collectively developed documents like Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose to consider constraints between words in the whole article based on their semantic relatedness and contextual distance. The proposed method is successfully implemented in both statistical and rule-based translators. We evaluate those systems by translating 100 articles in the English Wikipedia into Japanese. The results show that the ratio of appropriate word selection for common nouns increased to around 75% with our method, while it was around 55% without our method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A usual strategy to select the final answer in factoid Question-Answering (QA) relies on redundancy. A score is given to each candidate answer as a function of its frequency of occurrence, and the final answer is selected from the set of candidates sorted in decreasing order of score. For that purpose, systems often try to group together semantically equivalent answers. However, they hold several other semantic relations, such as inclusion, which are not considered, and candidates are mostly seen independently, as competitors. Our hypothesis is that not just equivalence, but other relations between candidate answers have impact on the performance of a redundancy-based QA system. In this paper, we describe experimental studies to back up this hypothesis. Our findings show that, with relatively simple techniques to recognize relations, systems' accuracy can be improved for answers of categories Number, Date and Entity.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Lexicalized Well-Founded Grammar (LWFG) is a recently developed syntactic-semantic grammar formalism for deep language understanding, which balances expressiveness with provable learnability results. The learnability result for LWFGs assumes that the semantic composition constraints are learnable. In this paper, we show what are the properties and principles the semantic representation and grammar formalism require, in order to be able to learn these constraints from examples, and give a learning algorithm. We also introduce a LWFG parser as a deductive system, used as an inference engine during LWFG induction. An example for learning a grammar for noun compounds is given.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The growing number of statistical topic models led to the need to better evaluate their output. Traditional evaluation means estimate the model’s fitness to unseen data. It has recently been proven than the output of human judgment can greatly differ from these measures. Thus the need for methods that better emulate human judgment is stringent. In this paper we present a system that computes the usefulness of individual topics from a given model on the basis of information drawn from a given ontology, in this case WordNet. The notion of utility is regarded as the ability to attribute a concept to each topic and separate words related to the topic from the unrelated ones based on that concept. In multiple experiments we prove the correlation between the automatic evaluation method and the answers received from human evaluators, for various corpora and difficulty levels. By changing the evaluation focus from a statistical one to a conceptual one we were able to detect which topics are conceptually meaningful and rank them accordingly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we present a graph-based approach aimed at learning a lexical taxonomy automatically starting from a domain corpus and the Web. Unlike many taxonomy learning approaches in the literature, our novel algorithm learns both concepts and relations entirely from scratch via the automated extraction of terms, definitions and hypernyms. This results in a very dense, cyclic and possibly disconnected hypernym graph. The algorithm then induces a taxonomy from the graph. Our experiments show that we obtain high-quality results, both when building brand-new taxonomies and when reconstructing WordNet sub-hierarchies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Designing dialog policies for voice-enabled interfaces is a tailoring job that is most often left to natural language processing experts. This job is generally redone for every new dialog task because cross-domain transfer is not possible. For this reason, machine learning methods for dialog policy optimization have been investigated during the last 15 years. Especially, reinforcement learning (RL) is now part of the state of the art in this domain. Standard RL methods require to test more or less random changes in the policy on users to assess them as improvements or degradations. This is called on policy learning. Nevertheless, it can result in system behaviors that are not acceptable by users. Learning algorithms should ideally infer an optimal strategy by observing interactions generated by a non-optimal but acceptable strategy, that is learning off-policy. In this contribution, a sample-efficient, online and off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to learn an optimal policy from few hundreds of dialogues generated with a very simple handcrafted policy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We investigate new methods for creating and applying ensembles for coreference resolution. While existing ensembles for coreference resolution are typically created using different learning algorithms, clustering algorithms or training sets, we harness recent advances in coreference modeling and propose to create our ensemble from a variety of supervised coreference models. However, the presence of pairwise and non-pairwise coreference models in our ensemble presents a challenge to its application: it is not immediately clear how to combine the coreference decisions made by these models. We investigate different methods for applying a model-heterogeneous ensemble for coreference resolution. Empirical results on the ACE data sets demonstrate the promise of ensemble approaches: all ensemble-based systems significantly outperform the best member of the ensemble.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper is concerned with the use of conversational agents as an interaction paradigm for accessing open domain encyclopedic knowledge by means of Wikipedia. More precisely, we describe a dialogue-based question answering system for German which utilizes Wikipedia-based topic models as a reference point for context detection and answer prediction. We investigate two different per- spectives to the task of interfacing virtual agents with collaborative knowledge. First, we exploit the use of Wikipedia categories as a basis for identifying the broader topic of a spoken utterance. Second, we describe how to enhance the conversational behavior of the virtual agent by means of a Wikipedia-based question answering component which incorporates the question topic. At large, our approach identifies topic-related focus terms of a user’s question, which are subsequently mapped onto a category taxonomy. Thus, we utilize the taxonomy as a reference point to derive topic labels for a user’s question. The employed topic model is thereby based on explicitly given concepts as represented by the document and category structure of the Wikipedia knowledge base. Identified topic categories are subsequently combined with different linguistic filtering methods to improve answer candidate retrieval and reranking. Results show that the topic model approach contributes to an enhancement of the conversational behavior of virtual agents.</p>

Metaphorical interpretation and affect detection using context profiles from open-ended text input are challenging in affective language processing field. In this paper, we explore recognition of a few typical affective metaphorical phenomena and context-based affect sensing using the modeling of speakers’ improvisational mood and other participants’ emotional influence to the speaking character under the improvisation of loose scenarios. The overall updated affect detection module is embedded in an AI agent. The new developments have enabled the AI agent to perform generally better in affect sensing tasks. The work emphasizes the conference themes on affective dialogue processing, human-agent interaction and intelligent user interfaces.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Entity linking maps name mentions in the documents to entries in a knowledge base through resolving the name variations and ambiguities. In this paper, we propose three advancements for entity linking. Firstly, expanding acronyms can effectively reduce the ambiguity of the acronym mentions. However, only rule-based approaches relying heavily on the presence of text markers have been used for entity linking. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning algorithm to expand more complicated acronyms encountered, which leads to 15.1% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art acronym expansion methods. Secondly, as entity linking annotation is expensive and labor intensive, to automate the annotation process without compromise of accuracy, we propose an instance selection strategy to effectively utilize the automatically generated annotation. In our selection strategy, an informative and diverse set of instances are selected for effective disambiguation. Lastly, topic modeling is used to model the semantic topics of the articles. These advancements give statistical significant improvement to entity linking individually. Collectively they lead the highest performance on KBP-2010 task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
To support more precise query translation for English-Chinese Bi-Directional Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), we have developed a novel framework by integrating a semantic network to characterize the correlations between multiple inter-related text terms of interest and learn their inter-related statistical query translation models. First, a semantic network is automatically generated from large-scale English-Chinese bilingual parallel corpora to characterize the correlations between a large number of text terms of interest. Second, the semantic network is exploited to learn the statistical query translation models for such text terms of interest. Finally, these inter-related query translation models are used to translate the queries more precisely and achieve more effective CLIR. Our experiments on a large number of official public data have obtained very positive results.</p>

In this paper, to support more precise Chinese Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) term detection and Part-of-Speech (POS) guessing, a unified mechanism is proposed and formulated based on the fusion of multiple features and supervised learning. Besides all the traditional features, the new features for statistical information and global contexts are introduced, as well as some constraints and heuristic rules, which reveal the relationships among OOV term candidates. Our experiments on the Chinese corpora from both People’s Daily and SIGHAN 2005 have achieved the consistent results, which are better than those acquired by pure rule-based or statistics-based models. From the experimental results for combining our model with Chinese monolingual retrieval on the data sets of TREC-9, it is found that the obvious improvement for the retrieval performance can also be obtained.</p>

This paper presents an algorithm for finding approximately optimal policies in very large Markov decision processes by constructing a hierarchical model and then solving it approximately. It exploits factored representations to achieve compactness and efficiency and to discover connectivity properties of the domain. We provide a bound on the quality of the solutions and give asymptotic analysis of the runtimes; in addition we demonstrate performance on a collection of very large domains. Results show that the quality of resulting policies is very good and the total running times, for both creating and solving the hierarchy, are significantly less than for an optimal factored MDP solver.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Planning with partial observability can be formulated as a non-deterministic search problem in belief space. The problem is harder than classical planning as keeping track of beliefs is harder than keeping track of states, and searching for action policies is harder than searching for action sequences. In this work, we develop a framework for partial observability that avoids these limitations and leads to a planner that scales up to larger problems. For this, the class of problems is restricted to those in which 1) the non-unary clauses representing the uncertainty about the initial situation are nvariant, and 2) variables that are hidden in the initial situation do not appear in the body of conditional effects, which are all assumed to be deterministic. We show that such problems can be translated in linear time into equivalent fully observable non-deterministic planning problems, and that an slight extension of this translation renders the problem solvable by means of classical planners. The whole approach is sound and complete provided that in addition, the state-space is connected. Experiments are also reported.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Markov Decision Processes arise as a natural model for many renewable resources allocation problems. In many such problems, high stakes decisions with potentially catastrophic outcomes (such as the collapse of an entire ecosystem) need to be taken by carefully balancing social, economic, and ecologic goals. We introduce a broad class of such MDP models with a risk averse attitude of the decision maker, in order to obtain policies that are more balanced with respect to the welfare of future generations. We prove that they admit a closed form solution that can be efficiently computed. We show an application of the proposed framework to the Pacific Halibut marine fishery, obtaining new and more cautious policies. Our results strengthen findings of related policies from the literature by providing new evidence that a policy based on periodic closures of the fishery should be employed, in place of the one traditionally used that harvests a constant proportion of the stock every year.</p>

We address a difficult, yet under-investigated class of planning problems: fully-observable nondeterministic (FOND) planning problems with strong cyclic solutions. The difficulty of these strong cyclic FOND planning problems stems from the large size of the state space. Hence, to achieve efficient planning, a planner has to cope with the explosion in the size of the state space by planning along the directions that allow the goal to be reached quickly. A major challenge is: how would one know which states and search directions are relevant before the search for a solution has even begun? We first describe an NDP-motivated strong cyclic algorithm that, without addressing the above challenge, can already outperform state-of-the-art FOND planners, and then extend this NDP-motivated planner with a novel heuristic that addresses the challenge.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The field of deterministic AI planning can roughly be divided into two approaches - classical state-based planning and hierarchical task network (HTN) planning. The plan existence problem of the former is known to be decidable while it has been proved undecidable for the latter. When extending HTN planning by allowing the unrestricted insertion of tasks and ordering constraints, one obtains a form of planning which is often referred to as "hybrid planning." We present a simplified formalization of HTN planning with and without task insertion. We show that the plan existence problem is undecidable for the HTN setting without task insertion and that it becomes decidable when allowing task insertion. In the course of the proof, we obtain an upper complexity bound of EXPSPACE for the plan existence problem for propositional HTN planning with task insertion.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Activity recognition aims to identify and predict human activities based on a series of sensor readings. In recent years, machine learning methods have become popular in solving activity recognition problems. A special difficulty for adopting machine learning methods is the workload to annotate a large number of sensor readings as training data. Labeling sensor readings for their corresponding activities is a time-consuming task. In practice, we often have a set of labeled training instances ready for an activity recognition task. If we can transfer such knowledge to a new activity recognition scenario that is different from, but related to, the source domain, it will ease our effort to perform manual labeling of training data for the new scenario. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework based on automatically learning a correspondence between different sets of sensors to solve this transfer-learning in activity recognition problem. We validate our framework on two different datasets and compare it against previous approaches of activity recognition, and demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Constrained partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs) extend the standard POMDPs by allowing the specification of constraints on some aspects of the policy in addition to the optimality objective for the value function. CPOMDPs have many practical advantages over standard POMDPs since they naturally model problems involving limited resource or multiple objectives. In this paper, we show that the optimal policies in CPOMDPs can be randomized, and present exact and approximate dynamic programming methods for computing randomized optimal policies. While the exact method requires solving a minimax quadratically constrained program (QCP) in each dynamic programming update, the approximate method utilizes the point-based value update with a linear program (LP). We show that the randomized policies are significantly better than the deterministic ones. We also demonstrate that the approximate point-based method is scalable to solve large problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Partial-order plans (POPs) have the capacity to compactly represent numerous distinct plan linearizations and as a consequence are inherently robust. We exploit this robustness to do effective execution monitoring. We characterize the conditions under which a POP remains viable as the regression of the goal through the structure of a POP. We then develop a method for POP execution monitoring via a structured policy, expressed as an ordered algebraic decision diagram. The policy encompasses both state evaluation and action selection, enabling an agent to seamlessly switch between POP linearizations to accommodate unexpected changes during execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it empirically and analytically to a standard technique for execution monitoring of sequential plans. On standard benchmark planning domains, our approach is 2 to 17 times faster and up to 2.5 times more robust than comparable monitoring of a sequential plan. On POPs that have few ordering constraints among actions, our approach is significantly more robust, with the ability to continue executing in up to an exponential number of additional states.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A* with admissible heuristics is a very successful approach to optimal planning. But how to derive such heuristics automatically? Merge-and-shrink abstraction (M&amp;S) is a general approach to heuristic design whose key advantage is its capability to make very fine-grained choices in defining abstractions. However, little is known about how to actually make these choices. We address this via the well-known notion of bisimulation. When aggregating only bisimilar states, M&amp;S yields a perfect heuristic. Alas, bisimulations are exponentially large even in trivial domains. We show how to apply label reduction — not distinguishing between certain groups of operators — without incurring any information loss, while potentially reducing bisimulation size exponentially. In several benchmark domains, the resulting algorithm computes perfect heuristics in polynomial time. Empirically, we show that approximating variants of this algorithm improve the state of the art in M&amp;S heuristics. In particular, a simple hybrid of two such variants is competitive with the leading heuristic LM-cut.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents a meta-heuristic algorithm for solving the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). This strategy, known as Iterative Flattening Search (IFS), iteratively applies a relaxation-step, in which a subset of scheduling decisions are randomly retracted from the current solution; and a solving-step, in which a new solution is incrementally recomputed from this partial schedule. This work contributes two separate results: (1) it proposes a constraint-based procedure extending an existing approach previously used for classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem; (2) it proposes an original relaxation strategy on feasible FJSSP solutions based on the idea of randomly breaking the execution orders of the activities on the machines and opening the resource options for some activities selected at random. The efficacy of the overall heuristic optimization algorithm is demonstrated on a set of well-known benchmarks.</p>

This paper considers a constraint-based scheduling approach to the flexible jobshop, a generalization of the traditional jobshop scheduling where activities have a choice of machines. It studies both large neighborhood (LNS) and adaptive randomized decomposition (ARD) schemes, using random, temporal, and machine decompositions. Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that, within 5 minutes, both LNS and ARD produce many new best solutions and are about 0.5% in average from the best-known solutions. Moreover, over longer runtimes, they improve 60% of the best-known solutions and match the remaining ones. The empirical results also show the importance of hybrid decompositions in LNS and ARD.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Classical planning has been notably successful in synthesizing finite plans to achieve states where propositional goals hold. In the last few years, classical planning has also been extended to incorporate temporally extended goals, expressed in temporal logics such as LTL, to impose restrictions on the state sequences generated by finite plans. In this work, we take the next step and consider the computation of infinite plans for achieving arbitrary LTL goals. We show that infinite plans can also be obtained efficiently by calling a classical planner once over a classical planning encoding that represents and extends the composition of the planning domain and the Buchi automaton representing the goal. This compilation scheme has been implemented and a number of experiments are reported.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Plan recognition is the problem of inferring the goals and plans of an agent from partial observations of her behavior. Recently, it has been shown that the problem can be formulated and solved using planners, reducing plan recognition to plan generation. In this work, we extend this model-based approach to plan recognition to the POMDP setting, where actions are stochastic and states are partially observable. The task is to infer a probability distribution over the possible goals of an agent whose behavior results from a POMDP model. The POMDP model is shared between agent and observer except for the true goal of the agent that is hidden to the observer. The observations are action sequences O that may contain gaps as some or even most of the actions done by the agent may not be observed. We show that the posterior goal distribution P(G|O) can be computed from the value function VG(b) over beliefs b generated by the POMDP planner for each possible goal G. Some extensions of the basic framework are discussed, and a number of experiments are reported.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Replanning via determinization is a recent, popular approach for onlineplanning in MDPs. In this paper we adapt this idea to classical,non-stochastic domains with partial information and sensing actions. At eachstep we generate a candidate plan which solves a classical planning probleminduced by the original problem. We execute this plan as long as it is safeto do so. When this is no longer the case, we replan.The classical planning problem we generate is based on the T0 translation, in which the classical state captures the knowledge state of theagent. We overcome the non-determinism in sensing actions, and the large domain size introduced by T0 by using state sampling. Our planner also employs a novel, lazy, regression-based method for querying the belief state.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Planning under uncertainty for multiagent systems can be formalized as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. We advance the state of the art for optimal solution of this model, building on the Multiagent A* heuristic search method. A key insight is that we can avoid the full expansion of a search node that generates a number of children that is doubly exponential in the node's depth. Instead, we incrementally expand the children only when a next child might have the highest heuristic value. We target a subsequent bottleneck by introducing a more memory-efficient representation for our heuristic functions. Proof is given that the resulting algorithm is correct and experiments demonstrate a significant speedup over the state of the art, allowing for optimal solutions over longer horizons for many benchmark problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper investigates the effectiveness of two state representations, CNF and DNF, in contingent planning. To this end, we developed a new contingent planner, called CNFct, using the AND/OR forward search algorithm PrAO [To et al., 2011] and an extension of the CNF representation of [To et al., 2010] for conformant planning to handle nondeterministic and sensing actions for contingent planning. The study uses CNFct and DNFct [To et al., 2011] and proposes a new heuristic function for both planners. The experiments demonstrate that both CNFct and DNFct offer very competitive performance in a large range of benchmarks but neither of the two representations is a clear winner over the other. The paper identifies properties of the representation schemes that can affect their performance on different problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a novel approach for solving unary SAS+ planning problems. This approach extends an SAS+ instance with new state variables representing intentions about how each original state variable will be used or changed next, and splits the original actions into several stages of intention followed by eventual execution. The result is a new SAS+ instance with the same basic solutions as the original. While the transformed problem is larger, it has additional structure that can be exploited to reduce the branching factor, leading to reachable state spaces that are many orders of magnitude smaller (and hence much faster planning) in several test domains with acyclic causal graphs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Markov decision process model is a powerful tool in planing tasks and sequential decision making problems. The randomness of state transitions and rewards implies that the performance of a policy is often stochastic. In contrast to the standard approach that studies the expected performance, we consider the policy that maximizes the probability of achieving a pre-determined target performance, a criterion we term <em>probabilistic goal Markov decision processes</em>. We show that this problem is NP-hard, but can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial algorithm. We further consider a variant dubbed "chance-constraint Markov decision problems," that treats the probability of achieving target performance as a constraint instead of the maximizing objective. This variant is NP-hard, but can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time.</p>

Robots depend on captured images for perceiving the environment. A robot can replace a human in capturing quality photographs for publishing. In this paper, we employ an iterative photo capture by robots (by repositioning itself) to capture good quality photographs. Our image quality assessment approach is based on few high level features of the image combined with some of the aesthetic guidelines of professional photography. Our system can also be used in web image search applications to rank images. We test our quality assessment approach on a large and diversified dataset and our system is able to achieve a classification accuracy of 79%. We assess the aesthetic error in the captured image and estimate the change required in orientation of the robot to retake an aesthetically better photograph. Our experiments are conducted on NAO robot with no stereo vision. The results demonstrate that our system can be used to capture professional photographs which are in accord with the human professional photography.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The variability of human behavior during plan execution poses a difficult challenge for human-robot teams. In this paper, we use the concepts of theory of mind to enable robots to account for two sources of human variability during team operation. When faced with an unexpected action by a human teammate, a robot uses a simulation analysis of different hypothetical cognitive models of the human to identify the most likely cause for the human's behavior. This allows the cognitive robot to account for variances due to both different knowledge and beliefs about the world, as well as different possible paths the human could take with a given set of knowledge and beliefs. An experiment showed that cognitive robots equipped with this functionality are viewed as both more natural and intelligent teammates, compared to both robots who either say nothing when presented with human variability, and robots who simply point out any discrepancies between the human's expected, and actual, behavior. Overall, this analysis leads to an effective, general approach for determining what thought process is leading to a human's actions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Object detection is a basic skill for a robot to perform tasks in human environments. In order to build a good object classifier, a large training set of labeled images is required; this is typically collected and labeled (often painstakingly) by a human. This method is not scalable and therefore limits the robot's detection performance. We propose an algorithm for a robot to collect more data in the environment during its training phase so that in the future it could detect objects more reliably. The first step is to plan a path for collecting additional training images, which is hard because a previously visited location affects the decision for the future locations. One key component of our work is path planning by building a sparse graph that captures these dependencies. The other key component is our learning algorithm that weighs the errors made in robot's data collection process while updating the classifier. In our experiments, we show that our algorithms enable the robot to improve its object classifiers significantly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We focus on recovering the 2D Euclidean structure in one view from the projections of N parallel conics in this paper. This work denotes that the conic dual to the absolute points is the general form of the conic dual to the circular points, but it does not encode the Euclidean structure. Therefore, we have to recover the circular point-envelope to find out some useful information about the Euclidean structure, which relies on the fact that the line at infinity and the symmetric axis can be recovered. We provide a solution to recover the two lines and deduce the constraints for recovering the conic dual to the circular points, then apply them on the camera calibration. Our work relaxes the problem conditions and gives a more general framework than the past. Experiments with simulated and real data are carried out to show the validity of the proposed algorithm. Especially, our method is applied in the endoscope operation to calibrate the camera for tracking the surgical tools, that is the main interest-point we pay attention to.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Activity recognition aims to discover one or more users’ actions and goals based on sensor readings. In the real world, a single user’s data are often insufficient for training an activity recognition model due to the data sparsity problem. This is especially true when we are interested in obtaining a personalized model. In this paper, we study how to collaboratively use different users’ sensor data to train a model that can provide personalized activity recognition for each user. We propose a user-dependent aspect model for this collaborative activity recognition task. Our model introduces user aspect variables to capture the user grouping information, so that a target user can also benefit from her similar users in the same group to train the recognition model. In this way, we can greatly reduce the need for much valuable and expensive labeled data required in training the recognition model for each user. Our model is also capable of incorporating time information and handling new user in activity recognition. We evaluate our model on a real-world WiFi data set obtained from an indoor environment, and show that the proposed model can outperform several state-of-art baseline algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Kalman Filtering is a computational tool with widespread applications in robotics, financial and weather forecasting, environmental engineering and defense. Given observation and state transition models, the Kalman Filter (KF) recursively estimates the state variables of a dynamic system. However, the KF requires a cubic time matrix inversion operation at every timestep which prevents its application in domains with large numbers of state variables. We propose Relational Gaussian Models to represent and model dynamic systems with large numbers of variables efficiently. Furthermore, we devise an exact lifted Kalman Filtering algorithm which takes only linear time in the number of random variables at every timestep. We prove that our algorithm takes linear time in the number of state variables even when individual observations apply to each variable. To our knowledge, this is the first lifted (linear time) algorithm for filtering with continuous dynamic relational models.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents new results for the (partial) maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem in Bayesian networks, which is the problem of querying the most probable state configuration of some of the network variables given evidence. It is demonstrated that the problem remains hard even in networks with very simple topology, such as binary polytrees and simple trees (including the Naive Bayes structure), which extends previous complexity results. Furthermore, a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for MAP in networks with bounded treewidth and bounded number of states per variable is developed. Approximation schemes were thought to be impossible, but here it is shown otherwise under the assumptions just mentioned, which are adopted in most applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper considers inference from multinomial data and addresses the problem of choosing the strength of the Dirichlet prior under a mean-squared error criterion. We compare the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the most commonly used Bayesian estimators obtained by assuming a prior Dirichlet distribution with non-informative prior parameters, that is, the parameters of the Dirichlet are equal and altogether sum up to the so called strength of the prior. Under this criterion, MLE becomes more preferable than the Bayesian estimators at the increase of the number of categories k of the multinomial, because non-informative Bayesian estimators induce a region where they are dominant that quickly shrinks with the increase of k. This can be avoided if the strength of the prior is not kept constant but decreased with the number of categories. We argue that the strength should decrease at least k times faster than usual estimators do.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We describe a generative Bayesian model for action understanding in which inverse-forward internal model pairs are considered "hypotheses" of plausible action goals that are explored in parallel via an approximate inference mechanism based on sequential Monte Carlo methods. The reenactment of internal model pairs can be considered a form of motor simulation, which supports both perceptual prediction and action understanding at the goal level. However, this procedure is generally considered to be computationally inefficient. We present a model that dynamically reallocates computational resources to more accurate internal models depending on both the available prior information and the prediction error of the inverse-forward models, and which leads to successful action recognition. We present experimental results that test the robustness and efficiency of our model in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper is devoted to sequential decision making under uncertainty, in the multi-prior framework of Gilboa and Schmeidler [1989]. In this setting, a set of probability measures (priors) is defined instead of a single one, and the decision maker selects a strategy that maximizes the minimum possible value of expected utility over this set of priors. We are interested here in the resolute choice approach, where one initially commits to a complete strategy and never deviates from it later. Given a decision tree representation with multiple priors, we study the problem of determining an optimal strategy from the root according to min expected utility. We prove the intractability of evaluating a strategy in the general case. We then identify different properties of a decision tree that enable to design dedicated resolution procedures. Finally, experimental results are presented that evaluate these procedures.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a new additive decomposition of probability tables that preserves equivalence of the joint distribution while reducing the size of potentials, without extra variables. We formulate the Most Probable Explanation (MPE) problem in belief networks as a Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP). Our pairwise decomposition allows to replace a cost function with smaller-arity functions. The resulting pairwise decomposed WCSP is then easier to solve using state-of-the-art WCSP techniques. Although testing pairwise decomposition is equivalent to testing pairwise independence in the original belief network, we show how to efficiently test and enforce it, even in the presence of hard constraints. Furthermore, we infer additional information from the resulting nonbinary cost functions by projecting and subtracting them on binary functions. We observed huge improvements by preprocessing with pairwise decomposition and project&amp;subtract compared to the current state-of-the-art solvers on two difficult sets of benchmark.</p>

How should we manage a sensor network to optimally guard security-critical infrastructure? How should we coordinate search and rescue helicopters to best locate survivors after a major disaster? In both applications, we would like to control sensing resources in uncertain, adversarial environments. In this paper, we introduce RSense, an efficient algorithm which guarantees near-optimal randomized sensing strategies whenever the detection performance satisfies submodularity, a natural diminishing returns property, for any fixed adversarial scenario. Our approach combines techniques from game theory with submodular optimization. The RSense algorithm applies to settings where the goal is to manage a deployed sensor network or to coordinate mobile sensing resources (such as unmanned aerial vehicles). We evaluate our algorithms on two real-world sensing problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multiagent planning has seen much progress with the development of formal models such as Dec-POMDPs. However, the complexity of these models—NEXP-Complete even for two agents—has limited scalability. We identify certain mild conditions that are sufficient to make multiagent planning amenable to a scalable approximation w.r.t. the number of agents. This is achieved by constructing a graphical model in which likelihood maximization is equivalent to plan optimization. Using the Expectation-Maximization framework for likelihood maximization, we show that the necessary inference can be decomposed into processes that often involve a small subset of agents, thereby facilitating scalability. We derive a global update rule that combines these local inferences to monotonically increase the overall solution quality. Experiments on a large multiagent planning benchmark confirm the benefits of the new approach in terms of runtime and scalability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Predicting trust among the agents is of great importance to various open distributed settings (e.g., e-market, peer-to-peer networks, etc.) in that dishonest agents can easily join the system and achieve their goals by circumventing agreed rules, or gaining unfair advantages, etc. Most existing trust mechanisms derive trust by statistically investigating the target agent's historical information. However, even if rich historical information is available, it is challenging to model an agent's behavior since an intelligent agent may strategically change its behavior to maximize its profits. We therefore propose a trust prediction approach to capture dynamic behavior of the target agent. Specifically, we first identify features which are capable of describing/representing context of a transaction. Then we use these features to measure similarity between context of the potential transaction and that of previous transactions to estimate trustworthiness of the potential transaction based on previous similar transactions' outcomes. Evaluation using real auction data and synthetic data demonstrates efficacy of our approach in comparison with an existing representative trust mechanism.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Specifying the reward function of a Markov decision process (MDP) can be demanding, requiring human assessment of the precise quality of, and tradeoffs among, various states and actions. However, reward functions often possess considerable structure which can be leveraged to streamline their specification. We develop new, decision-theoretically sound heuristics for eliciting rewards for factored MDPs whose reward functions exhibit additive independence. Since we can often find good policies without complete reward specification, we also develop new (exact and approximate) algorithms for robust optimization ofimprecise-reward MDPs with such additive reward. Our methods are evaluated in two domains: autonomic computing and assistive technology.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Imprecise-reward Markov decision processes (IRMDPs) are MDPs in which the reward function is only partially specified (e.g., by some elicitation process). Recent work using minimax regret to solve IRMDPs has shown, despite their theoretical intractability, how the set of policies that are nondominated w.r.t. reward uncertainty can be exploited to accelerate regret computation. However, the number of nondominated policies is generally so large as to undermine this leverage. In this paper, we show how the quality of the approximation can be improved online by pruning/adding nondominated policies during reward elicitation, while maintaining computational tractability. Drawing insights from the POMDP literature, we also develop a new anytime algorithm for constructing the set of nondominated policies with provable (anytime) error bounds. These bounds can be exploited to great effect in our online approximation scheme.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We discuss a novel approach for dealing with single-stage stochastic constraint satisfaction problems (SCSPs) that include random variables over a continuous or large discrete support. Our approach is based on two novel tools: sampled SCSPs and (α,ϑ)-solutions. Instead of explicitly enumerating a very large or infinite set of future scenarios, we employ statistical estimation to determine if a given assignment is consistent for a SCSP. As in statistical estimation, the quality of our estimate is determined via confidence interval analysis. In contrast to existing approaches based on sampling, we provide likelihood guarantees for the quality of the solutions found. Our approach can be used in concert with existing strategies for solving SCSPs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Probabilistic logical languages provide powerful formalisms forknowledge representation and learning. Yet performing inference inthese languages is extremely costly, especially if it is done at thepropositional level. Lifted inference algorithms, which avoid repeatedcomputation by treating indistinguishable groups of objects as one, helpmitigate this cost. Seeking inspiration from logical inference, wherelifted inference (e.g., resolution) is commonly performed, we developa model theoretic approach to probabilistic lifted inference. Our algorithmcompiles a first-order probabilistic theory into a first-orderdeterministic decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF) circuit.Compilation offers the advantage that inference is polynomial in thesize of the circuit. Furthermore, by borrowing techniques from theknowledge compilation literature our algorithm effectively exploitsthe logical structure (e.g., context-specific independencies) withinthe first-order model, which allows more computation to be done at the lifted level.An empirical comparison demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In multidimensional classification the goal is to assign an instance to a set of different classes. This task is normally addressed either by defining a compound class variable with all the possible combinations of classes (label power-set methods, LPMs) or by building independent classifiers for each class (binary-relevance methods, BRMs). However, LPMs do not scale well and BRMs ignore the dependency relations between classes. We introduce a method for chaining binary Bayesian classifiers that combines the strengths of classifier chains and Bayesian networks for multidimensional classification. The method consists of two phases. In the first phase, a Bayesian network (BN) that represents the dependency relations between the class variables is learned from data. In the second phase, several chain classifiers are built, such that the order of the class variables in the chain is consistent with the class BN. At the end we combine the results of the different generated orders. Our method considers the dependencies between class variables and takes advantage of the conditional independence relations to build simplified models. We perform experiments with a chain of naive Bayes classifiers on different benchmark multidimensional datasets and show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

We present a new recommender system for online dating. Using a large dataset from a major online dating website, we first show that similar people, as defined by a set of personal attributes, like and dislike similar people and are liked and disliked by similar people. This analysis provides the foundation for our Content-Collaborative Reciprocal (CCR) recommender approach. The content-based part uses selected user profile features and similarity measure to generate a set of similar users. The collaborative filtering part uses the interactions of the similar users, including the people they like/dislike and are liked/disliked by, to produce reciprocal recommendations. CCR addresses the cold start problem of new users joining the site by being able to provide recommendations immediately, based on their profiles. Evaluation results show that the success rate of the recommendations is 69.26% compared with a baseline of 35.19% for the top 10 ranked recommendations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Extracting the relations that exist between two entities is an important step in numerousWeb-related tasks such as information extraction.A supervised relation extraction system that is trained to extract a particular relation type might not accurately extract a new type of a relation for which it has not been trained.However, it is costly to create training data manually for every new relation type that one might want to extract.We propose a method to adapt an existing relation extraction system to extractnew relation types with minimum supervision. Our proposed method comprises two stages: learning a lower-dimensional projection between different relations, and learning a relational classifier for the target relation type with instance sampling. We evaluate the proposed method using a dataset that contains 2000 instances for 20 different relation types. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a statistically significant macro-average F-score of 62.77. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms numerous baselines and a previously proposed weakly-supervised relation extraction method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Record linkage is the process of matching records between two (or multiple) data sets that represent the same real-world entity. An exhaustive record linkage process involves computing the similarities between all pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large data sets. Blocking techniques alleviate this problem by dividing the records into blocks and only comparing records within the same block. To be adaptive from domain to domain, one category of blocking technique formalizes 'construction of blocking scheme' as a machine learning problem. In the process of learning the best blocking scheme, previous learning-based techniques utilize only a set of labeled data. However, since the set of labeled data is usually not large enough to well characterize the unseen (unlabeled) data, the resultant blocking scheme may poorly perform on the unseen data by generating too many candidate matches. To address that, in this paper, we propose to utilize unlabeled data (in addition to labeled data) for learning blocking schemes. Our experimental results show that using unlabeled data in learning can remarkably reduce the number of candidate matches while keeping the same level of coverage for true matches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Complex networks pervade in diverse areas ranging from the natural world to the engineered world and from traditional application domains to new and emerging domains, including web-based social networks. Of crucial importance to the understanding of many network phenomena, dynamics and functions is the study of network structural properties. One important type of network structure is known as community structure which refers to the existence of communities that are tightly knit local groups with relatively dense connections among their members. Community detection is the problem of detecting these communities automatically. In this paper, based on the modularity measure proposed previously for community detection, we first propose a reformulation of an optimization problem for the 2-partition problem. Based on this new formulation, we can extend it naturally for tackling the general k-partition problem directly without having to tackle multiple 2-partition subproblems like what other methods do. We then propose a convex relaxation scheme to give an iterative algorithm which solves a simple quadratic program in each iteration. We empirically compare our method with some related methods and find that our method is both scalable and competitive in performance via maintaining a good tradeoff between efficiency and quality.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Largely motivated by Semantic Web applications, many highly scalable, but incomplete, query answering systems have been recently developed. Evaluating the scalability-completeness trade-off exhibited by such systems is an important requirement for many applications. In this paper, we address the problem of formally comparing complete and incomplete systems given an ontology schema (or TBox) T. We formulate precise conditions on TBoxes T expressed in the EL, QL or RL profile of OWL 2 under which an incomplete system is indistinguishable from a complete one w.r.t. T, regardless of the input query and data. Our results also allow us to quantify the "degree of incompleteness" of a given system w.r.t. T as well as to automatically identify concrete queries and data patterns for which the incomplete system will miss answers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Extracting a subset of a given ontology that captures all the ontology's knowledge about a specified set of terms is a well-understood task. This task can be based, for instance, on locality-based modules. However, a single module does not allow us to understand neither topicality, connectedness, structure, or superfluous parts of an ontology, nor agreement between actual and intended modeling. The strong logical properties of locality-based modules suggest that the family of all such modules of an ontology can support comprehension of the ontology as a whole. However, extracting that family is not feasible, since the number of locality-based modules of an ontology can be exponential w.r.t. its size. In this paper we report on a new approach that enables us to efficiently extract a polynomial representation of the family of all locality-based modules of an ontology. We also describe the fundamental algorithm to pursue this task, and report on experiments carried out and results obtained.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Affinity Propagation is a state-of-the-art clustering method recently proposed by Frey and Dueck. It has been successfully applied to broad areas of computer science research because it has much better clustering performance than traditional clustering methods such as k-means. In order to obtain high quality sets of clusters, the original Affinity Propagation algorithm iteratively exchanges real-valued messages between all pairs of data points until convergence. However, this algorithm does not scale for large datasets because it requires quadratic CPU time in the number of data points to compute the messages. This paper proposes an efficient Affinity Propagation algorithm that guarantees the same clustering result as the original algorithm after convergence. The heart of our approach is (1) to prune unnecessary message exchanges in the iterations and (2) to compute the convergence values of pruned messages after the iterations to determine clusters. Experimental evaluations on several different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We show that power-law analyses of financial commentaries from newspaper web-sites can be used to identify stock market bubbles, supplementing traditional volatility analyses. Using a four-year corpus of 17,713 online, finance-related articles (10M+ words) from the Financial Times, the New York Times, and the BBC, we show that week-to-week changes in power-law distributions reflect market movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), the FTSE-100, and the NIKKEI-225. Notably, the statistical regularities in language track the 2007 stock market bubble, showing emerging structure in the language of commentators, as progressively greater agreement arose in their positive perceptions of the market. Furthermore, during the bubble period, a marked divergence in positive language occurs as revealed by a Kullback-Leibler analysis.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We investigate the possibility of using structured data to improve search over unstructured documents. In particular, we use relevance feedback to create a `virtuous cycle' between structured data gathered from the Semantic Web and web-pages gathered from the hypertext Web. Previous approaches have generally considered searching over the Semantic Web and hypertext Web to be entirely disparate, indexing and searching over different domains. Our novel approach is to use relevance feedback from hypertext Web results to improve Semantic Web search, and results from the Semantic Web to improve the retrieval of hypertext Web data. In both cases, our evaluation is based on certain kinds of informational queries (abstract concepts, people, and places) selected from a real-life query log and checked by human judges. We show our relevance model-based system is better than the performance of real-world search engines for both hypertext and Semantic Web search, and we also investigate Semantic Web inference and pseudo-relevance feedback.</p>

We have developed a novel hybrid representation for Music Information Retrieval. Our representation is built by incorporating audio content into the tag space in a tag-track matrix, and then learning hybrid concepts using latent semantic analysis. We apply this representation to the task of music recommendation, using similarity-based retrieval from a query music track. We also develop a new approach to evaluating music recommender systems, which is based upon the relationship of users liking tracks. We are interested in measuring the recommendation quality, and the rate at which cold-start tracks are recommended. Our hybrid representation is able to outperform a tag-only representation, in terms of both recommendation quality and the rate that cold-start tracks are included as recommendations.</p>

Fashion magazines contain a number of photographs of fashion models, and their clothing coordinates serve as useful references. In this paper, we propose a recommender system for clothing coordinates using full-body photographs from fashion magazines. The task is that, given a photograph of a fashion item (e.g. tops) as a query, to recommend a photograph of other fashion items (e.g. bottoms) that is appropriate to the query. With the proposed method, we use a probabilistic topic model for learning information about coordinates from visual features in each fashion item region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using real photographs from a fashion magazine and two fashion style sharing services with the task of making top (bottom) recommendations given bottom (top) photographs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Real-world social networks are dynamic in nature. Companies continue to collaborate, align strategically, acquire, and merge over time, and receive positive/negative impact from other companies. Consequently, their performance changes with time. If one can understand what types of network changes affect a company's value, he/she can predict the future value of the company, grasp industry innovations, and make business more successful. However, it often requires continuous records of relational changes, which are often difficult to track for companies, and the models of mining longitudinal network are quite complicated. In this study, we developed algorithms and a system to infer large-scale evolutionary company networks from public news during 1981--2009. Then, based on how networks change over time, as well as the financial information of the companies, we predicted company profit growth. This is the first study of longitudinal network-mining-based company performance analysis in the literature.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Since the seminal work of Sampath et al. in 1996, despite the subsequent flourishing of techniques on diagnosis of discrete-event systems (DESs), the basic notions of fault and diagnosis have been remaining conceptually unchanged. Faults are defined at component level and diagnoses incorporate the occurrences of component faults within system evolutions: diagnosis is context-free. As this approach may be unsatisfactory for a complex DES, whose topology is organized in a hierarchy of abstractions, we propose to define different diagnosis rules for different subsystems in the hierarchy. Relevant fault patterns are specified as regular expressions on patterns of lower-level subsystems. Separation of concerns is achieved and the expressive power of diagnosis is enhanced: each subsystem has its proper set of diagnosis rules, which may or may not depend on the rules of other subsystems. Diagnosis is no longer anchored to components: it becomes context-sensitive. The approach yields seemingly contradictory but nonetheless possible scenarios: a subsystem can be normal despite the faulty behavior of a number of its components (positive paradox); also, it can be faulty despite the normal behavior of all its components (negative paradox).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given the number of online sources for news, the volumes of news generated are so daunting that gaining insight from these collections become impossible without some aid to link them. Semantic linking of news articles facilitates grouping of similar or relevant news stories together for ease of human consumption. For example, a political analyst may like to have a single view of all news articles that report visits of State heads of different countries to a single country to make an in-depth analytical report on the possible impacts of all associated events. It is likely that no news source links all the relevant news together. In this paper, we discuss a multi-resolution, multi-perspective news analysis system that can link news articles collected from diverse sources over a period of time. The distinctive feature of the proposed news linking system is its capability to simultaneously link news articles and stories at multiple levels of granularity. At the lowest level several articles reporting the same event are linked together. Higher level groupings are more contextual and semantic. We have deployed a range of algorithms that use statistical text processing and Natural Language Processing techniques. The system is incremental in nature and depicts how stories have evolved over time along with main actors and activities. It also illustrates how a single story diverges into multiple themes or multiple stories converge due to conceptual similarity. Accuracy of linking thematically and conceptually linked news articles are also presented.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Collaborative filtering (CF) techniques recommend items to users based on their historical ratings. In real-world scenarios, user interests may drift over time since they are affected by moods, contexts, and pop culture trends. This leads to the fact that a user's historical ratings comprise many aspects of user interests spanning a long time period. However, at a certain time slice, one user's interest may only focus on one or a couple of aspects. Thus, CF techniques based on the entire historical ratings may recommend inappropriate items. In this paper, we consider modeling user-interest drift over time based on the assumption that each user has multiple counterparts over temporal domains and successive counterparts are closely related. We adopt the cross-domain CF framework to share the static group-level rating matrix across temporal domains, and let user-interest distribution over item groups drift slightly between successive temporal domains. The derived method is based on a Bayesian latent factor model which can be inferred using Gibbs sampling. Our experimental results show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art recommendation performance as well as explicitly track and visualize user-interest drift over time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent research has highlighted the benefits of completeness as a retrieval criterion in recommender systems. In complete retrieval, any subset of the constraints in a given query that can be satisfied must be satisfied by at least one of the retrieved products. Minimal completeness (i.e., always retrieving the smallest set of products needed for completeness) is also beginning to attract research interest as a way to minimize cognitive load in the approach. Other important features of a retrieval algorithm’s behavior include the diversity of the retrieved products and the order in which they are presented to the user. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for minimally complete retrieval (MCR) in which the ranking of retrieved products is primarily based on the number of constraints that they satisfy, but other measures such as similarity or utility can also be used to inform the retrieval process. We also present theoretical and empirical results that demonstrate our algorithm’s ability to minimize cognitive load while ensuring the completeness and diversity of the retrieved products.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Subjective assessments (SAs) are assigned by users against items, such as ’elegant’ and ’gorgeous’, and are common in reviews/tags in many online-sites. However, previous studies fail to effectively use SAs for improving recommendations because few users rate the same items with the same SAs, which triggers the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering. We propose a novel algorithm that links a taxonomy of items to a taxonomy of SAs to assess user interests in detail. That is, it merges the SAs assigned by users against an item into subjective classes (SCs) and reflects the SAs/SCs assigned to an item to its classes. Thus, it can measure the similarity of users from not only SAs/SCs assigned to items but also their classes, which overcomes the sparsity problem. Our evaluation, which uses data from a popular restaurant review site, shows that our method generates more accurate recommendations than previous methods. Furthermore, we find that SAs frequently assigned on a few item classes are more useful than those widely assigned against many item classes in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Linked Data paradigm has evolved into a powerful enabler for the transition from the document-oriented Web into the Semantic Web. While the amount of data published as Linked Data grows steadily and has surpassed 25 billion triples, less than 5\% of these triples are links between knowledge bases. Link discovery frameworks provide the functionality necessary to discover missing links between knowledge bases. Yet, this task requires a significant amount of time, especially when it is carried out on large data sets. This paper presents and evaluates LIMES, a novel time-efficient approach for link discovery in metric spaces. Our approach utilizes the mathematical characteristics of metric spaces during the mapping process to filter out a large number of those instance pairs that do not suffice the mapping conditions. We present the mathematical foundation and the core algorithms employed in LIMES. We evaluate our algorithms with synthetic data to elucidate their behavior on small and large data sets with different configurations and compare the runtime of LIMES with another state-of-the-art link discovery tool.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Data sparsity due to missing ratings is a major challenge for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques in recommender systems. This is especially true for CF domains where the ratings are expressed numerically. We observe that, while we may lack the information in numerical ratings, we may have more data in the form of binary ratings. This is especially true when users can easily express themselves with their likes and dislikes for certain items. In this paper, we explore how to use the binary preference data expressed in the form of like/dislike to help reduce the impact of data sparsity of more expressive numerical ratings. We do this by transferring the rating knowledge from some auxiliary data source in binary form (that is, likes or dislikes), to a target numerical rating matrix. Our solution is to model both numerical ratings and like/dislike in a principled way, using a novel framework of Transfer by Collective Factorization (TCF). In particular, we construct the shared latent space collectively and learn the data-dependent effect separately. A major advantage of the TCF approach over previous collective matrix factorization (or bi-factorization) methods is that we are able to capture the data-dependent effect when sharing the data-independent knowledge, so as to increase the overall quality of knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCF at various sparsity levels as compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Information retrieval may suggest a document, and information extraction may tell us what it says, but which information sources do we trust and which assertions do we believe when different authors make conflicting claims? Trust algorithms known as fact-finders attempt to answer these questions, but consider only which source makes which claim, ignoring a wealth of background knowledge and contextual detail such as the uncertainty in the information extraction of claims from documents, attributes of the sources, the degree of similarity among claims, and the degree of certainty expressed by the sources. We introduce a new, generalized fact-finding framework able to incorporate this additional information into the fact-finding process. Experiments using several state-of-the-art fact-finding algorithms demonstrate that generalized fact-finders achieve significantly better performance than their original variants on both semi-synthetic and real-world problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most of the text mining tasks, such as clustering, is dominated by statistical approaches that treat text as a bag of words. Semantics in the text is largely ignored in the mining process, and the mining results are often not easily interpretable. One particular challenge faced by such approaches is short text understanding, as short text lacks enough content from which a statistical conclusion can be drawn. For example, traditional topic analysis methods consider topic segments with tens of hundreds of words. Latent topic modeling, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, also requires sufficient words to infer document topic distribution. We enhance machine learning algorithms by first giving the machine a probabilistic knowledgebase that contains as big, rich, and consistent concepts (of worldly facts) as those in our mental world. Then a Bayesian inference mechanism is developed to conceptualize words and short text. We conducted comprehensive tests of our method on conceptualizing set of text terms, as well as clustering Twitter messages (tweets), which are typically approximately ten words long. Compared to latent semantic topic modeling and other four kinds of methods that using WordNet, Freebase and Wikipedia (category links and explicit semantic analysis), we show significant improvements in terms of tweets clustering accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There are two key issues for information diffusion in blogosphere: (1) blog posts are usually short, noisy and contain multiple themes, (2) information diffusion through blogosphere is primarily driven by the “word-of-mouth” effect, thus making topics evolve very fast. This paper presents a novel topic tracking approach to deal with these issues by modeling a topic as a semantic graph in which the semantic relatedness between terms are learned from Wikipedia. For a given topic/post, the named entities, Wikipedia concepts, and the semantic relatedness are extracted to generate the graph model. Noises are filtered out through a graph clustering algorithm. To handle topic evolution, the topic model is enriched by using Wikipedia as background knowledge. Furthermore, graph edit distance is used to measure the similarity between a topic and its posts. The proposed method is tested using real-world blog data. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed method on tracking topics in short, noisy text.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Matching large ontologies is a challenge due to the high time complexity. This paper proposes a new matching method for large ontologies based on reduction anchors. This method has a distinct advantage over the divide-and-conquer methods because it dose not need to partition large ontologies. In particular, two kinds of reduction anchors, positive and negative reduction anchors, are proposed to reduce the time complexity in matching. Positive reduction anchors use the concept hierarchy to predict the ignorable similarity calculations. Negative reduction anchors use the locality of matching to predict the ignorable similarity calculations. Our experimental results on the real world data sets show that the proposed method is efficient for matching large ontologies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Different from Laplacian or normal matrix, the properties of the adjacency eigenspace received much less attention. Recent work showed that nodes projected into the adjacency eigenspace exhibit an orthogonal line pattern and nodes from the same community locate along the same line. In this paper, we conduct theoretical studies based on graph perturbation to demonstrate why this line orthogonality property holds in the adjacency eigenspace and why it generally disappears in the Laplacian and normal eigenspaces. Using the orthogonality property in the adjacency eigenspace, we present a graph partition algorithm, AdjCluster, which first projects node coordinates to the unit sphere and then applies the classic k-means to find clusters. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data and real-world social networks validate our theoretical findings and show the effectiveness of our graph partition algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Transfer learning addresses the problems that labeled training data are insufficient to produce a high-performance model. Typically, given a target learning task, most transfer learning approaches require to select one or more auxiliary tasks as sources by the designers. However, how to select the right source data to enable effective knowledge transfer automatically is still an unsolved problem, which limits the applicability of transfer learning. In this paper, we take one step ahead and propose a novel transfer learning framework, known as source-selection-free transfer learning (SSFTL), to free users from the need to select source domains. Instead of asking the users for source and target data pairs, as traditional transfer learning does, SSFTL turns to some online information sources such as World Wide Web or the Wikipedia for help. The source data for transfer learning can be hidden somewhere within this large online information source, but the users do not know where they are. Based on the online information sources, we train a large number of classifiers. Then, given a target task, a bridge is built for labels of the potential source candidates and the target domain data in SSFTL via some large online social media with tag cloud as a label translator. An added advantage of SSFTL is that, unlike many previous transfer learning approaches, which are difficult to scale up to the Web scale, SSFTL is highly scalable and can offset much of the training work to offline stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SSFTL through extensive experiments on several real-world datasets in text classification.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The possibility that influenza activity can be generally detected through search log analysis has been explored in recent years. However, previous studies have mainly focused on influenza, and little attention has been paid to other epidemics. With an analysis of web user behavior data, we consider the problem of predicting the tendency of hand-foot -and-mouth disease (HFMD), whose out-break in 2010 resulted in a great panic in China. In addi-tion to search queries, we consider users’ interactions with search engines. Given the collected search logs, we cluster HFMD-related search queries, medical pages and news reports into the following sets: epidemic-related queries (ERQs), epidemic-related pages (ERPs) and ep-idemic-related news (ERNs). Furthermore, we count their own frequencies as different features, and we conduct a regression analysis with current HFMD occurrences. The experimental results show that these features exhibit good performances on both accuracy and timeliness.</p>

We propose a personalized re-ranking algorithm through mining user dwell times derived from a user's previously online reading or browsing activities. We acquire document level user dwell times via a customized web browser, from which we then infer concept word level user dwell times in order to understand a user's personal interest. According to the estimated concept word level user dwell times, our algorithm can estimate a user's potential dwell time over a new document, based on which personalized webpage re-ranking can be carried out. We compare the rankings produced by our algorithm with rankings generated by popular commercial search engines and a recently proposed personalized ranking algorithm. The results clearly show the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Measuring the semantic meaning between words is an important issue because it is the basis for many applications, such as word sense disambiguation, document summarization, and so forth. Although it has been explored for several decades, most of the studies focus on improving the effectiveness of the problem, i.e., precision and recall. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency issue, that given a collection of words, how to efficiently discover the top-k most semantic similar words to the query. This issue is very important for real applications yet the existing state-of-the-art strategies cannot satisfy users with reasonable performance. Efficient strategies on searching top-k semantic similar words are proposed. We provide an extensive comparative experimental evaluation demonstrating the advantages of the introduced strategies over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper identifies a widely existing phenomenon in web data, which we call the "words of few mouths" phenomenon. This phenomenon, in the context of online reviews, refers to the case that a large fraction of the reviews are each voted only by very few users. We discuss the challenges of "words of few mouths" in the development of recommender systems based on users' opinions and advocate probabilistic methodologies to handle such challenges. We develop a probabilistic model and correspondingly a logistic regression based learning algorithm for review helpfulness prediction. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms not only in the presence of the "words of few mouths" phenomenon, but also in the absence of such phenomena.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Human environments are challenging for robots, which need to be trainable by lay people and learn new behaviours rapidly without disrupting much the ongoing activity. A system that integrates AI techniques for planning and learning is here proposed to satisfy these strong demands. The approach rapidly learns planning operators from few action experiences using a competitive strategy where many alternatives of cause-effect explanations are evaluated in parallel, and the most successful ones are used to generate the operators. The success of a cause-effect explanation is evaluated by a probabilistic estimate that compensates the lack of experience, producing more confident estimations and speeding up the learning in relation to other known estimates. The system operates without task interruption by integrating in the planning-learning loop a human teacher that supports the planner in making decisions. All the mechanisms are integrated and synchronized in the robot using a general decision-making framework. The feasibility and scalability of the architecture are evaluated in two different robot platforms: a Stäubli arm, and the humanoid ARMAR III.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents a plan recognition algorithm for inferring student behavior using virtual science laboratories. The algorithm extends existing plan recognition technology and was integrated with an existing educational application for chemistry. Automatic recognition of students’ activities in virtual laboratories can provide important information to teachers as well as serve as the basis for intelligent tutoring. Student use of virtual laboratories presents several challenges: Students may repeat activities indefinitely, interleave between activities, and engage in exploratory behavior using trial-anderror. The plan recognition algorithm uses a recursive grammar that heuristically generates plans on the fly, taking into account chemical reactions and effects to determine students’ intended high-level actions. The algorithm was evaluated empirically on data obtained from college students using virtual laboratory software for teaching chemistry. Results show that the algorithm was able to (1) infer the plans used by students to construct their models; (2) recognize such key processes as titration and dilution when they occurred in students’ work; (3) identify partial solutions; (4) isolate sequences of actions that were part of a single error.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Deep space missions are characterized by severely constrained communication links. To meet the needs of future missions and increase their scientific return, future space systems will require an increased level of autonomy on-board. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach to on-board autonomy relying on model-based reasoning, and encompassing many important reasoning capabilities such as plan generation, validation, execution and monitoring, FDIR, and run-time diagnosis. The controlled platform is represented symbolically, and the reasoning capabilities are seen as symbolic manipulation of such formal model. We have developed a prototype of our framework, implemented within an on-board Autonomous Reasoning Engine. We have evaluated our approach on two case-studies inspired by real-world, ongoing projects, and characterized it in terms of reliability, availability and performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents a new Monte-Carlo search algorithm for very large sequential decision-making problems. We apply non-linear regression within Monte-Carlo search, online, to estimate a state-action value function from the outcomes of random roll-outs. This value function generalizes between related states and actions, and can therefore provide more accurate evaluations after fewer rollouts. A further significant advantage of this approach is its ability to automatically extract and leverage domain knowledge from external sources such as game manuals. We apply our algorithm to the game of Civilization II, a challenging multi-agent strategy game with an enormous state space and around 10^21 joint actions. We approximate the value function by a neural network, augmented by linguistic knowledge that is extracted automatically from the official game manual. We show that this non-linear value function is significantly more efficient than a linear value function, which is itself more efficient than Monte-Carlo tree search. Our non-linear Monte-Carlo search wins over 78% of games against the built-in AI of Civilization II.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Statutory records of underground utility apparatus (such as pipes andcables) are notoriously inaccurate, so street surveys are usually undertakenbefore road excavation takes place to minimize the extent and duration ofexcavation and for health and safety reasons. This involves the use ofsensors such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). The GPR scans are thenmanually interpreted and combined with the expectations from the utilityrecords and other data such as surveyed manholes. The task is complex owingto the difficulty in interpreting the sensor data, and the spatialcomplexity and extent of under street assets. We explore the application ofAI techniques, in particular Bayesian data fusion (BDF), to automaticallygenerate maps of buried apparatus. Hypotheses about the spatial location anddirection of buried assets are extracted by identifying hyperbolae in theGPR scans. The spatial location of surveyed manholes provides further inputto the algorithm, as well as the prior expectations from the statutoryrecords. These three data sources are used to produce the most probable mapof the buried assets. Experimental results on real and simulated data setsare presented.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we describe how we integrated an artificial intelligence (AI) system into the PubMed search website using augmented browsing technology. Our system dynamically enriches the PubMed search results displayed in a user’s browser with semantic annotation provided by several natural language processing (NLP) subsystems, including a sentence splitter, a part-of-speech tagger, a named entity recognizer, a section categorizer and a gene normalizer (GN). After our system is installed, the PubMed search results page is modified on the fly to categorize sections and provide additional information on gene and gene products identified by our NLP subsystems. In addition, GN involves three main steps: candidate ID matching, false positive filtering and disambiguation, which are highly dependent on each other. We propose a joint model using a Markov logic network (MLN) to model the dependencies found in GN. The experimental results show that our joint model outperforms a baseline system that executes the three steps separately.

What is structure of water surrounding proteins remains as one of fundamental unsolved problems of science. Methods in biophysics only provide qualitative description of the structure and thus clarifying the collective phenomena of a huge number of water molecules is still beyond intuition in biophysics. We introduce a simulation-based data mining approach that quantitatively model the structure of water surrounding a protein as clusters of water molecules having similar moving behavior. The paper presents and explains how the advances of AI technique can potentially solve this challenging data-intensive problem.</p>

LogAnswer is a question answering (QA) system for the German language, aimed at providing concise and correct answers to arbitrary questions. For this purpose LogAnswer is designed as an embedded artificial intelligence system which integrates methods from several fields of AI, namely natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation and automated theorem proving. We intend to employ LogAnswer as a virtual user within Internet-based QA forums, where it must be able to identify the questions that it cannot answer correctly, a task that normally receives little attention in QA research compared to the actual answer derivation. The paper presents a machine learning solution to the wrong answer avoidance (WAA) problem, applying a meta classifier to the output of simple term-based classifiers and a rich set of other WAA features. Experiments with a large set of real-world questions from a QA forum show that the proposed method significantly improves the WAA characteristics of our system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In an introductory engineering course with an annual enrollment of over 1000 students, a professor has little option but to rely on multiple choice exams for midterms and finals. Furthermore, the teaching assistants are too overloaded to give detailed feedback on submitted homework assignments. We introduce Mechanix, a computer-assisted tutoring system for engineering students. Mechanix uses recognition of freehand sketches to provide instant, detailed, and formative feedback as the student progresses through each homework assignment, quiz, or exam. Free sketch recognition techniques allow students to solve free-body diagram and static truss problems as if they were using a pen and paper. The same recognition algorithms enable professors to add new unique problems simply by sketching out the correct answer. Mechanix is able to ease the burden of grading so that instructors can assign more free response questions, which provide a better measure of student progress than multiple choice questions do.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Robots must perform tasks efficiently and reliably while acting underuncertainty. One way to achieve efficiency is to give the robot common-sense knowledge about the structure of the world. Reliable robot behaviour can be achieved by modelling the uncertaintyin the world probabilistically. We present a robot system that combines these two approaches and demonstrate the improvements in efficiency and reliability that result. Our first contribution is a probabilistic relational model integrating common-sense knowledge about the world in general, with observations of a particular environment. Our second contribution is a continual planning system which is able to plan in the large problems posed by that model, by automatically switching between decision-theoretic and classical procedures. We evaluate our system on object search tasks in two different real-world indoor environments. By reasoning about the trade-offs between possible courses of action with different informational effects, and exploiting the cues and general structures of those environments, our robot is able to consistently demonstrate efficient and reliable goal-directed behaviour.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Goal-driven autonomy (GDA) is a reflective model of goal reasoning that controls the focus of an agent’s planning activities by dynamically resolving unexpected discrepancies in the world state, which frequently arise when solving tasks in complex environments. GDA agents have performed well on such tasks by integrating methods for discrepancy recognition, explanation, goal formulation, and goal management. However, they require substantial domain knowledge, including what constitutes a discrepancy and how to resolve it. We introduce LGDA, a learning algorithm for acquiring this knowledge, modeled as cases, that and integrates case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning methods. We assess its utility on tasks from a complex video game environment. We claim that, for these tasks, LGDA can significantly outperform its ablations. Our evaluation provides evidence to support this claim. LGDA exemplifies a feasible design methodology for deployable GDA agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose to extract a compact yet discriminative visual descriptor directly on the mobile device, which tackles the wireless query transmission latency in mobile landmark search. This descriptor is offline learnt from the location contexts of geo-tagged Web photos from both Flickr and Panoramio with two phrases: First, we segment the landmark photo collections into discrete geographical regions using a Gaussian Mixture Model [Stauffer et al., 2000]. Second, a ranking sensitive vocabulary boosting is introduced to learn a compact codebook within each region. To tackle the locally optimal descriptor learning caused by imprecise geographical segmentation, we further iterate above phrases by feedback an “entropy” based descriptor compactness into a prior distribution to constrain the Gaussian mixture modeling. Consequently, when entering a specific geographical region, the codebook in the mobile device is downstream adapted, which ensures efficient extraction of compact descriptor, its low bit rate transmission, as well as promising discrimination ability. We deploy our descriptor within both HTC and iPhone mobile phones, testing landmark search in typical areas included Beijing, New York, and Barcelona containing one million images. Our learning descriptor outperforms alternative compact descriptors [Chen et al., 2009][Chen et al., 2010][Chandrasekhar et al., 2009a][Chandrasekhar et al., 2009b] with a large margin.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The original Yahoo! search engine consists of manually organized topic hierarchy of webpages for easy browsing. Modern search engines (such as Google and Bing), on the other hand, return a flat list of webpages based on keywords. It would be ideal if hierarchical browsing and keyword search can be seamlessly combined. The main difficulty in doing so is to automatically (i.e., not manually) classify and rank a massive number of webpages into various hierarchies (such as topics, media types, regions of the world). In this paper we report our attempt towards building this integrated search engine, called SEE (Search Engine with hiErarchy). We implement a hierarchical classification system based on Support Vector Machines, and embed it in SEE. We also design a novel user interface that allows users to dynamically adjust their desire for a higher accuracy vs. more results in any (sub)category of the hierarchy. Though our current search engine is still small (indexing about 1.2 million webpages), the results, including a small user study, have shown a great promise for integrating such techniques in the next-generation search engine.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Knowledge acquisition is the essential process of extracting and encoding knowledge, both domainspecific and commonsense, to be used in intelligent systems. While many large knowledge bases have been constructed, none is close to complete. This paper presents an approach to improving a knowledge base efficiently under resource constraints. Using a guiding knowledge base, questions are generated from a weak form of similarity-based inference given the glossary mapping between two knowledge bases. The candidate questions are prioritized in terms of the concept coverage of the target knowledge. Experiments were conducted to find questions to grow the Chinese ConceptNet using the English ConceptNet as a guide. The results were evaluated by online users to verify that 94.17% of the questions and 85.77% of the answersare good. In addition, the answers collected in a six-week period showed consistent improvement to a 36.33% increase in concept coverage of the Chinese commonsense knowledge base against the English ConceptNet.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One drawback with using plan recognition in adversarial games is that often players must commit to a plan before it is possible to infer the opponent's intentions. In such cases, it is valuable to couple plan recognition with plan repair, particularly in multi-agent domains where complete replanning is not computationally feasible. This paper presents a method for learning plan repair policies in real-time using Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT). We demonstrate how these policies can be coupled with plan recognition in an American football game (Rush 2008) to create an autonomous offensive team capable of responding to unexpected changes in defensive strategy. Our real-time version of UCT learns play modifications that result in a significantly higher average yardage and fewer interceptions than either the baseline game or domain-specific heuristics. Although it is possible to use the actual game simulator to measure reward offline, to execute UCT in real-time demands a different approach; here we describe two modules for reusing data from offline UCT searches to learn accurate state and reward estimators.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Several logistics service providers serve a certain number of customers, geographically spread over an area of operations. They would like to coordinate their operations so as to minimize overall cost. At the same time, they would like to keep information about their costs, constraints and preferences private, thus precluding conventional negotiation. We show how AI techniques, in particular Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP), can be integrated with cryptographic techniques to allow such coordination without revealing agents' private information. The problem of assigning customers to companies is formulated as a DCOP, for which we propose two novel, privacy-preserving algorithms. We compare their performances and privacy properties on a set of Vehicle Routing Problem benchmarks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In the past few years, sentiment analysis and opinion mining becomes a popular and important task. These studies all assume that their opinion resources are real and trustful. However, they may encounter the faked opinion or opinion spam problem. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of our product review mining system. On product review site, people may write faked reviews, called review spam, to promote their products, or defame their competitors' products. It is important to identify and filter out the review spam. Previous work only focuses on some heuristic rules, such as helpfulness voting, or rating deviation, which limits the performance of this task. In this paper, we exploit machine learning methods to identify review spam. Toward the end, we manually build a spam collection from our crawled reviews. We first analyze the effect of various features in spam identification. We also observe that the review spammer consistently writes spam. This provides us another view to identify review spam: we can identify if the author of the review is spammer. Based on this observation, we provide a two-view semi-supervised method, co-training, to exploit the large amount of unlabeled data. The experiment results show that our proposed method is effective. Our designed machine learning methods achieve significant improvements in comparison to the heuristic baselines.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In today's services driven economic environment, it is imperative for organizations to provide better quality service experience to differentiate and grow their business. Customer satisfaction (C-SAT) is the key driver for retention and growth in Retail Banking. Wait time, the time spent by a customer at the branch before getting serviced, contributes significantly to C-SAT. Due to high footfall, it is improbable to improve the wait time of every customer walking in the branch. Therefore, banks in developing countries are strategically looking to segment its customers and services and offer differentiated QoS based service delivery. In this work, we present a system for customer segmentation, and scheduling based on historic value of the customer and characteristics of current service request. We describe the system and give mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem and the associated heuristics. We present results and experience of deployment of this solution in multiple branches of a leading bank in India.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper addresses one of the key components of the mining process: the geological prediction of natural resources from spatially distributed measurements. We present a novel approach combining undirected graphical models with ensemble classifiers to provide 3D geological models from multiple sensors installed in an autonomous drill rig. Drill sensor measurements used for drilling automation, known as measurement-while-drilling (MWD) data, have the potential to provide an estimate of the geological properties of the rocks being drilled. The proposed method maps MWD parameters to rock types while considering spatial relationships, i.e., associating measurements obtained from neighboring regions. We use a conditional random field with local information provided by boosted decision trees to jointly reason about the rock categories of neighboring measurements. To validate the approach, MWD data was collected from a drill rig operating at an iron ore mine. Graphical models of the 3D structure present in real data sets possess a high number of nodes, edges and cycles, making them intractable for exact inference. We provide a comparison of three approximate inference methods to calculate the most probable distribution of class labels. The empirical results demonstrate the benefits of spatial modeling through graphical models to improve classification performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a method to predict users’ interests in social media, using time-evolving, multinomial relational data. We exploit various actions performed by users, and their preferences to predict user interests. Actions performed by users in social media such as Twitter, Delicious and Facebook have two fundamental properties. (a) User actions can be represented as high-dimensional or multinomial relations - e.g. referring URLs, bookmarking and tagging, clicking a favorite button on a post etc. (b) User actions are time-varying and user-specific – each user has unique preferences that change over time. Consequently, it is appropriate to represent each user’s action at some point in time as a multinomial relational data. We propose ActionGraph, a novel graph representation for modeling users’ multinomial, time-varying actions. Each user’s action at some time point is represented by an action node. ActionGraph is a bipartite graph whose edges connect an action node to its involving entities, referred to as object nodes. Using real-world social media data, we empirically justify the proposed graph structure. Our experimental results show that the proposed ActionGraph improves the accuracy in a user interest prediction task by outperforming several baselines including standard tensor analysis, a previously proposed state-of-the-art LDA-based method and other graph-based variants. Moreover, the proposed method shows robust performances in the presence of sparse data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we describe a software assistant agent that can proactively assist human users situated in a time-constrained environment to perform normative reasoning--reasoning about prohibitions and obligations--so that the user can focus on her planning objectives. In order to provide proactive assistance, the agent must be able to 1) recognize the user's planned activities, 2) reason about potential needs of assistance associated with those predicted activities, and 3) plan to provide appropriate assistance suitable for newly identified user needs. To address these specific requirements, we develop an agent architecture that integrates user intention recognition, normative reasoning over a user's intention, and planning, execution and replanning for assistive actions. This paper presents the agent architecture and discusses practical applications of this approach.</p>

Willow is a free-text Adaptive Computer Assisted Assessment system, which supports natural language processing and user modeling. In this paper we discuss the benefits coming from extending Willow with recommendations. The approach combines human computer interaction methods to elicit the recommendations with data mining techniques to adjust their definition. Following a scenario-based approach, 12 recommendations were designed and delivered in a large scale evaluation with 377 learners. A statistically significant positive impact was found on indicators dealing with the engagement in the course, the learning effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the knowledge acquisition. We present the overall system functionality, the interaction among the different subsystems involved and some evaluation findings.</p>

We propose a framework that adds learning for improving plan selection in the popular BDI agent programming paradigm. In contrast with previous proposals, the approach given here is able to scale up well with the complexity of the agent's plan library. Technically, we develop a novel confidence measure which allows the agent to adjust its reliance on the learning dynamically, facilitating in principle infinitely many (re)learning phases. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach in an example controller for energy management.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Complex adaptive systems (CAS) are composed of interacting agents, exhibit nonlinear properties such as positive and negative feedback, and tend to produce emergent behavior that cannot be wholly explained by deconstructing the system into its constituent parts. Both system dynamics (equation-based) approaches and agent-based approaches have been used to model such systems, and each has its benefits and drawbacks. In this paper, we introduce a class of agent-based models with an embedded system dynamics model, and detail the semantics of a simulation framework for these models. This model definition, along with the simulation framework, combines agent-based and system dynamics approaches in a way that retains the strengths of both paradigms. We show the applicability of our model by instantiating it for two example complex adaptive systems in the field of Computational Sustainability, drawn from ecology and epidemiology. We then present a more detailed application in epidemiology, in which we compare a previously unstudied intervention strategy to established ones. Our experimental results, unattainable using previous methods, yield insight into the effectiveness of these intervention strategies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Because of the inevitable impact factors such as pose, expression, lighting and aging on faces, identity verification through faces is still an unsolved problem. Research on biometrics raises an even challenging problem — is it possible to determine the kinship merely based on face images? A critical observation that faces of parents captured while they were young are more alike their children's compared with images captured when they are old has been revealed by genetics studies. This enlightens us the following research. First, a new kinship database named UB KinFace composed of child, young parent and old parent face images is collected from Internet. Second, an extended transfer subspace learning method is proposed aiming at mitigating the enormous divergence of distributions between children and old parents. The key idea is to utilize an intermediate distribution close to both the source and target distributions to bridge them and reduce the divergence. Naturally the young parent set is suitable for this task. Through this learning process, the large gap between distributions can be significantly reduced and kinship verification problem becomes more discriminative. Experimental results show that our hypothesis on the role of young parents is valid and transfer learning is effective to enhance the verification accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Activity recognition using mobile phones has great potential in many applications including mobile healthcare. In order to let a person easily know whether he is in strict compliance with the doctor's exercise prescription and adjust his exercise amount accordingly, we can use a smart-phone based activity reporting system to accurately recognize a range of daily activities and report the duration of each activity. A triaxial accelerometer embedded in the smart phone is used for the classification of several activities, such as staying still, walking, running, and going upstairs and downstairs. The model learnt from a specific person often cannot yield accurate results when used on a different person. To solve the cross-people activity recognition problem, we propose an algorithm known as TransEMDT (Transfer learning EMbedded Decision Tree) that integrates a decision tree and the k-means clustering algorithm for personalized activity-recognition model adaptation. Tested on a real-world data set, the results show that our algorithm outperforms several traditional baseline algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Chinese Pinyin input methods are very important for Chinese language processing. In many cases, users may make typing errors. For example, a user wants to type in "shenme" (meaning "what" in English) but may type in "shenem" instead. Existing Pinyin input methods fail in converting such a Pinyin sequence with errors to the right Chinese words. To solve this problem, we developed an efficient error-tolerant Pinyin input method called "CHIME'' that can handle typing errors. By incorporating state-of-the-art techniques and language-specific features, the method achieves a better performance than state-of-the-art input methods. It can efficiently find relevant words in milliseconds for an input Pinyin sequence.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In Bayesian machine learning, conjugate priors are popular, mostly due to mathematical convenience. In this paper, we show that there are deeper reasons for choosing a conjugate prior. Specically, we formulate the conjugate prior in the form of Bregman divergence and show that it is the inherent geometry of conjugate priors that makes them appropriate and intuitive. This geometric interpretation allows one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as the eective sample points, thus providing additional intuition. We use this geometric understanding of conjugate priors to derive the hyperparameters and expression of the prior used to couple the generative and discriminative components of a hybrid model for semi-supervised learning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Network alarm triage refers to grouping and prioritizing a stream of low-level device health information to help operators find and fix problems. Today, this process tends to be largely manual because existing rule-based tools cannot easily evolve with the network. We present CueT, a system that uses interactive machine learning to constantly learn from the triaging decisions of operators. It then uses that learning in novel visualizations to help them quickly and accurately triage alarms. Unlike prior interactive machine learning systems, CueT handles a highly dynamic environment where the groups of interest are not known a priori and evolve constantly. Our evaluations with real operators and data from a large network show that CueT significantly improves the speed and accuracy of alarm triage.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Clause learning is a technique used by back-tracking-based propositional satisfiability solvers, where some clauses obtained by analysis of conflicts are added to the formula during backtracking. It has been observed empirically that clause learning does not significantly improve the performance of a solver when restricted to learning clauses of small width only. This experience is supported by lower bound theorems. It is shown that lower bounds on the runtime of width-restricted clause learning follow from lower bounds on the width of resolution proofs. This yields the first lower bounds on width-restricted clause learning for formulas in 3-CNF.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce a game-theoretic framework to address the community detection problem based on the social networks’ structure. The dynamics of community formation is framed as a strategic game called community formation game: Given a social network, each node is selfish and selects communities to join or leave based on her own utility measurement. A community structure can be interpreted as an equilibrium of this game. We formulate the agents’ utility by the combination of a gain function and a loss function. Each agent can select multiple communities, which naturally captures the concept of “overlapping communities”. We propose a gain function based on Newman’s modularity function and a simple loss function that reflects the intrinsic costs incurred when people join the communities. We conduct extensive experiments under this framework; our results show that our algorithm is effective in identifying overlapping communities, and is often better than other algorithms we evaluated especially when many people belong to multiple communities.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents an algorithm of adaptation for a case-based reasoning system with cases and domain knowledge represented in the expressive description logic ALC. The principle is to first pretend that the source case to be adapted solves the current target case. This may raise some contradictions with the specification of the target case and with the domain knowledge. The adaptation consists then in repairing these contradictions. This adaptation algorithm is based on an extension of the classical tableau method used for deductive inferences in ALC.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The paper investigates a novel approach, based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), to predict potential 3D conformations of a protein via fragments assembly. The fragments are extracted and clustered by a preprocessor from a database of known protein structures. Assembling fragments into a complete conformation is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem solved using CLP. The approach makes use of a simplified CA-side chain centroid protein model, that offers efficiency and a good approximation for space filling. The approach adapts existing energy models for protein representation and applies a large neighboring search (LNS) strategy. The results show the feasibility and efficiency of the method, and the declarative nature of the approach simplifies the introduction of additional knowledge and variations of the model.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We investigate the problem of influencing the preferences of players within a Boolean game so that, if all players act rationally, certain desirable outcomes will result. The way in which we influence preferences is by overlaying games with taxation schemes. In a Boolean game, each player has unique control of a set of Boolean variables, and the choices available to the player correspond to the possible assignments that may be made to these variables. Each player also has a goal, represented by a Boolean formula, that they desire to see satisfied. Whether or not a player’s goal is satisfied will depend both on their own choices and on the choices of others, which gives Boolean games their strategic charac- ter. We extend this basic framework by introducing an external principal who is able to levy a taxation scheme on the game, which imposes a cost on every possible action that a player can choose. By designing a taxation scheme appropriately, it is possible to perturb the preferences of the players, so that they are incentivised to choose some equilibrium that would not otherwise be chosen. After motivating and formally presenting our model, we explore some issues surrounding it, including the complexity of finding a taxation scheme that implements some socially desirable outcome, and then discuss desirable properties of taxation schemes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consider a combinatorial state space S, such as the set of all truth assignments to N Boolean variables. Given a partition of S, we consider the problem of estimating the size of all the subsets in which S is divided. This problem, also known as computing the density of states, is quite general and has many applications. For instance, if we consider a Boolean formula in CNF and we partition according to the number of violated constraints, computing the density of states is a generalization of both SAT, MAXSAT and model counting. We propose a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the density of states of Boolean formulas that is based on a flat histogram approach. Our method represents a new approach to a variety of inference, learning, and counting problems. We demonstrate its practical effectiveness by showing that the method converges quickly to an accurate solution on a range of synthetic and real-world instances.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we present a novel user interface that integrates two popular approaches to language translation for travelers allowing multimodal communication between the parties involved: the picture-book, in which the user simply points to multiple picture icons representing what they want to say, and the statistical machine translation system that can translate arbitrary word sequences. Our prototype system tightly couples both processes within a translation framework that inherits many of the the positive features of both approaches, while at the same time mitigating their main weaknesses. Our system differs from traditional approaches in that its mode of input is a sequence of pictures, rather than text or speech. Text in the source language is generated automatically, and is used as a detailed representation of the intended meaning. The picture sequence which not only provides a rapid method to communicate basic concepts but also gives a `second opinion' on the machine transition output that catches machine translation errors and allows the users to retry the translation, avoiding misunderstandings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There is a huge and growing number of systems that depend on batteries for power supply, ranging from small mobile devices to large high-powered systems such as electrical substations. In most of these systems, there are significant user-benefits or engineering reasons to base the supply on multiple batteries, with load being switched between batteries by a control system. The key to efficient use of multiple batteries lies in the design of effective policies for the management of the switching of load between them. This paper describes work in which we show that automated planning can produce much more effective policies than other approaches to multiple battery load management in the literature.</p>

We show how Finite Model Computation (FMC) of first-order theories can efficiently and transparentlybe solved by taking advantage of an extension of Answer Set Programming, called incremental Answer Set Programming (iASP). The idea is to use the incremental parameter in iASP programs to account for the domain size of a model. The FMC problem is then successively addressed for increasing domain sizes until an answer set, representing a finite model of the original first-order theory, is found. We developed a system based on the iASP solver iClingo and demonstrate its competitiveness.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There is interest in artificial intelligence for principled techniques to analyze inconsistent information. This stems from the recognition that the dichotomy between consistent and inconsistent sets of formulae that comes from classical logics is not sufficient for describing inconsistent information. We review some existing proposals and make new proposals for measures of inconsistency and measures of information, and then prove that they are all pairwise incompatible. This shows that the notion of inconsistency is a multi-dimensional concept where different measures provide different insights. We then explore relationships between measures of inconsistency and measures of information in terms of the trade-offs they identify when using them to guide resolution of inconsistency.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A plan with rich control structures like branches and loops can usually serve as a general solution that solves multiple planning instances in a domain. However, the correctness of such generalized plans is non-trivial to define and verify, especially when it comes to whether or not a plan works for all of the infinitely many instances of the problem. In this paper, we give a precise definition of a generalized plan representation called an FSA plan, with its semantics defined in the situation calculus. Based on this, we identify a class of infinite planning problems, which we call one-dimensional (1d), and prove a correctness result that 1d problems can be verified by finite means. We show that this theoretical result leads to an algorithm that does this verification practically, and a planner based on this verification algorithm efficiently generates provably correct plans for 1d problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users who have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model in a principled way. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many complex robot motor skills can be represented using elementary movements, and there exist efficient techniques for learning parametrized motor plans using demonstrations and self-improvement. However with current techniques, in many cases, the robot currently needs to learn a new elementary movement even if a parametrized motor plan exists that covers a related situation. A method is needed that modulates the elementary movement through the meta-parameters of its representation. In this paper, we describe how to learn such mappings from circumstances to meta-parameters using reinforcement learning. In particular we use a kernelized version of the reward-weighted regression. We show two robot applications of the presented setup in robotic domains; the generalization of throwing movements in darts, and of hitting movements in table tennis. We demonstrate that both tasks can be learned successfully using simulated and real robots.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The use of ontologies for accessing data is one of the most exciting new applications of description logic in databases and other information systems. A realistic way of realising sufficiently scalable ontology- based data access in practice is by reduction to querying relational databases. In this paper, we describe the ‘combined approach,’ which incorporates the information given by the ontology into the data and employs query rewriting to eliminate spurious answers. We illustrate this approach for ontologies given in the DL-Lite family of description logics and briefly discuss the results obtained for the EL family.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Semantic Web aims to offer an interoperable environment that will allow users to safely delegate complex actions to intelligent agents. Much work has been done for agents' interoperability; especially in the areas of ontology-based metadata and rule-based reasoning. Nevertheless, the SW proof layer has been neglected so far, although it is vital for agents and humans to understand how a result came about, in order to increase the trust in the interchanged information. This paper focuses on the implementation of third party SW reasoning and proofing services wrapped as agents in a multi-agent framework. This way, agents can exchange and justify their arguments without the need to conform to a common rule paradigm. Via external reasoning and proofing services, the receiving agent can grasp the semantics of the received rule set and check the validity of the inferred results.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We review recent results on inferencing for SROEL(×), a description logic that subsumes the main features of the W3C recommendation OWL EL. Rule-based deduction systems are developed for various reasoning tasks and logical sublanguages. Certain feature combinations lead to increased space upper bounds for materialisation, suggesting that efficient implementations are easier to obtain for suitable fragments of OWL EL.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tree-matching problems arise in many computational domains. The literature provides several methods for creating correspondences between labeled trees; however, by definition, tree-matching algorithms rigidly preserve ancestry. That is, once two nodes have been placed in correspondence, their descendants must be matched as well. We introduce flexible tree matching, which relaxes this rigid requirement in favor of a tunable formulation in which the role of hierarchy can be controlled. We show that flexible tree matching is strongly NP-complete, give a stochastic approximation algorithm for the problem, and demonstrate how structured prediction techniques can learn the algorithm's parameters from a set of example matchings. Finally, we present results from applying the method to tasks in Web design.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Case-based problem-solving systems reason by retrieving relevant prior cases and adapting their solutions to fit new circumstances. The ability of case-based reasoning (CBR) to reason from ungeneralized episodes can benefit knowledge acquisition, but acquiring the needed case adaptation knowledge has proven challenging. This paper presents a method for alleviating this problem with just-in-time gathering of case adaptation knowledge, based on introspective reasoning and mining of Web knowledge sources. The approach combines knowledge planning with introspective reasoning to guide recovery from case adaptation failures and reinforcement learning to guide selection of knowledge sources. The failure recovery and knowledge source selection methods have been tested in three highly different domains with encouraging results. The paper closes with a discussion of limitations and future steps.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The goal of rating-based recommender systems is to make personalized predictions and recommendations for individual users by leveraging the preferences of a community of users with respect to a collection of items like songs or movies. Recommender systems are often based on intricate statistical models that are estimated from data sets containing a very high proportion of missing ratings. This work describes evidence of a basic incompatibility between the properties of recommender system data sets and the assumptions required for valid estimation and evaluation of statistical models in the presence of missing data. We discuss the implications of this problem and describe extended modelling and evaluation frameworks that attempt to circumvent it. We present prediction and ranking results showing that models developed and tested under these extended frameworks can significantly outperform standard models.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Semi-supervised learning algorithms commonly incorporate the available background knowledge such that an expression of the derived model's quality is improved. Depending on the specific context quality can take several forms and can be related to the generalization performance or to a simple clustering coherence measure. Recently, a novel perspective of semi-supervised learning has been put forward, that associates semi-supervised clustering with the efficiency of spectral methods. More precisely, it has been demonstrated that the appropriate use of partial supervision can bias the data Laplacian matrix such that the necessary eigenvector computations are provably accelerated. This result allows data mining practitioners to use background knowledge not only for improving the quality of clustering results, but also for accelerating the required computations. In this paper we initially provide a high level overview of the relevant efficiency maximizing semi-supervised methods such that their theoretical intuitions are comprehensively outlined. Consecutively, we demonstrate how these methods can be extended to handle multiple clusters and also discuss possible issues that may arise in the continuous semi-supervised solution. Finally, we illustrate the proposed extensions empirically in the context of text clustering.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In their groundbreaking paper, Bartholdi, Tovey and Trick [1989] argued that many well-known voting rules, such as Plurality, Borda, Copeland and Maximin are easy to manipulate. An important assumption made in that paper is that the manipulator’s goal is to ensure that his preferred candidate is among the candidates with the maximum score, or, equivalently, that ties are broken in favor of the manipulator’s preferred candidate. In this paper, we examine the role of this assumption in the easiness results of [Bartholdi et al., 1989]. We observe that the algorithm presented in [Bartholdi et al., 1989] extends to all rules that break ties according to a fixed ordering over the candidates. We then show that all scoring rules are easy to manipulate if the winner is selected from all tied candidates uniformly at random. This result extends to Maximin under an additional assumption on the manipulator’s utility function that is inspired by the original model of [Bartholdi et al., 1989]. In contrast, we show that manipulation becomes hard when arbitrary polynomial-time tie-breaking rules are allowed, both for the rules considered in [Bartholdi et al., 1989], and for a large class of scoring rules.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Ontologies that evolve through use to support new domain tasks can grow extremely large. Moreover, large ontologies require more resources to use and have slower response times than small ones. To help address this problem, we present an on-line semantic forgetting algorithm that removes ontology fragments containing infrequently used or cheap to relearn concepts. We situate our algorithm in an extension of the widely used RoboCup Rescue platform, which provides simulated tasks to agents. We show that our agents send fewer messages and complete more tasks, and thus achieve a greater degree of success, than other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We describe an innovative application of a novel game-theoretic approach for a \textit{national scale} security deployment. Working with the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA), we have developed a new application called GUARDS to allocate the TSA's limited resources across hundreds of security activities to provide protection at over 400 United States airports. Similar security applications (e.g., ARMOR and IRIS) have focused on one-off tailored applications and one security activity (e.g. checkpoints) per application, GUARDS on the other hand faces three new key issues: (i) reasoning about hundreds of heterogeneous security activities; (ii) reasoning over diverse potential threats; (iii) developing a system designed for hundreds of end-users. Since a national deployment precludes tailoring to specific airports, our key ideas are: (i) creating a new game-theoretic framework that allows for heterogeneous defender activities and compact modeling of a large number of threats; (ii) developing an efficient solution technique based on general purpose Stackelberg game solvers; (iii) taking a partially centralized approach for knowledge acquisition. The scheduling assistant has been delivered to the TSA and is currently undergoing evaluation for scheduling practices at an undisclosed airport. If successful, the TSA intends to incorporate the system into their unpredictable scheduling practices nationwide.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There are common intuitions about how social graphs are generated (for example, it is common to talk informally about nearby nodes sharing a link). There are also common heuristics for predicting whether two currently unlinked nodes in a graph should be linked (e.g. for suggesting friends in an online social network or movies to customers in a recommendation network). This paper provides what we believe to be the first formal connection between these intuitions and these heuristics. We look at a familiar class of graph generation models in which nodes are associated with locations in a latent metric space and connections are more likely between closer nodes. We also look at popular linkprediction heuristics such as number-of-commonneighbors and its weighted variants [Adamic and Adar, 2003] which have proved successful in predicting missing links, but are not direct derivatives of latent space graph models. We provide theoretical justifications for the success of some measures as compared to others, as reported in previous empirical studies. In particular we present a sequence of formal results that show bounds related to the role that a node’s degree plays in its usefulness for link prediction, the relative importance of short paths versus long paths, and the effects of increasing non-determinism in the link generation process on link prediction quality. Our results can be generalized to any model as long as the latent space assumption holds.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most of the existing personalization systems such as content recommenders or targeted ads focus on individual users and ignore the social situation in which the services are consumed. However, many human activities are social and involve several in-dividuals whose tastes and expectations must be taken into account by the system. When a group profile is not available, different profile aggrega-tion strategies can be applied to recommend ade-quate items to a group of users based on their indi-vidual profiles. We consider an approach intended to determine the factors that influence the choice of an aggregation strategy. We present evaluations made on a large-scale dataset of TV viewings, where real group interests are compared to the pre-dictions obtained by combining individual user profiles according to different strategies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The process of extracting useful knowledge from large datasets has become one of the most pressing problems in today’s society. The problem spans entire sectors, from scientists to intelligence analysts and web users, all of whom are constantly struggling to keep up with the larger and larger amounts of content published every day. With this much data, it is often easy to miss the big picture. In this paper, we investigate methods for automatically connecting the dots – providing a structured, easy way to navigate within a new topic and discover hidden connections. We focus on the news domain: given two news articles, our system automatically finds a coherent chain linking them together. For example, it can recover the chain of events leading from the decline of home prices (2007) to the health-care debate (2009). We formalize the characteristics of a good chain and provide efficient algorithms to connect two fixed endpoints. We incorporate user feedback into our framework, allowing the stories to be refined and personalized. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm over real news data. Our user studies demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in helping users understanding the news.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Some of the most successful machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, are based on learning linear and kernel predictors with respect to a convex loss function, such as the hinge loss. For classification purposes, a more natural loss function is the 0-1 loss. However, using it leads to a non-convex problem for which there is no known efficient algorithm. In this paper, we describe and analyze a new algorithm for learning linear or kernel predictors with respect to the 0-1 loss function. The algorithm is parameterized by L, which quantifies the effective width around the decision boundary in which the predictor may be uncertain. We show that without any distributional assumptions, and for any fixed $L$, the algorithm runs in polynomial time, and learns a classifier which is worse than the optimal such classifier by at most ε. We also prove a hardness result, showing that under a certain cryptographic assumption, no algorithm can learn such classifiers in time polynomial in L.</p>

This paper concerns the creation of an efficient, continuous, non-parametric representation of surfaces implicit in 3D laser data as typically recorded by mobile robots. Our approach explicitly leverages the probabilistic nature of Gaussian Process regression to provide for a principled, adaptive subsampling which automatically prunes redundant data. The algorithm places no restriction on the complexity of the underlying surfaces and enables predictions at arbitrary locations and densities. We present results using real and synthetic data and show that our approach attains decimation factors in excess of two orders of magnitude without significant degradation in fidelity of the workspace reconstructions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Today, mobile robots are increasingly expected to operate in ever more complex and dynamic environments.In order to carry out many of the higher level tasks envisioned a semantic understanding of a workspace is pivotal. Here our field has benefited significantly from successes in machine learning and vision: applications in robotics of off-the-shelf object detectors are plentiful. This paper outlines an online, any-time planning framework enabling the active exploration of such detections. Our approach exploits the ability to move to different vantage points and implicitly weighs the benefits of gaining more certainty about the existence of an object against the physical cost of the exploration required. The result is a robot which plans trajectories specifically to decrease the entropy of putative detections. Our system is demonstrated to significantly improve detection performance and trajectory length in simulated and real robot experiments.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Artificial intelligence has a long history of learning from domain problems ranging from chess to jeopardy. In this work, we look at a problem stemming from social science, namely, how do social relationships influence communication content and vice versa. The tools used to study communication content (content analysis) have rarely been combined with those used to study social relationships (social network analysis). Furthermore, there is even less work addressing the longitudinal characteristics of such a combination. This paper presents a general framework for measuring the dynamic bi-directional influence between communication content and social networks. The framework leverages the idea that knowledge about both kinds of networks can be represented using the same knowledge representation. In particular, through the use of Semantic Web standards, the extraction of networks is made easier. The framework is applied to two use-cases: online forum discussions and conference publications. The results provide a new perspective over the dynamics involving both social networks and communication content.</p>

Image annotation datasets are becoming larger and larger, with tens of millions of images and tens of thousands of possible annotations.

Our method, called Wsabie, both outperforms several baseline methods and is faster and consumes less memory.</p>

Many people read online reviews written by other users to learn more about a product or venue. However, the overwhelming amount of user- generated reviews and variance in length, detail and quality across the reviews make it difficult to glean useful information. In this paper, we present a summarization system called Review Spotlight. It provides a brief overview of reviews by using adjective- noun word pairs extracted from the review text. The system also allows the user to click any word pair to read the original sentences from which the word pair was extracted. We present our system implementation as a Google Chrome browser extension, and an evaluation on how two word pair scoring methods (TF and TF-IDF) affect the identification of useful word pairs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Linear classification is a useful tool for dealing with large-scale data in applications such as document classification and natural language processing. Recent developments of linear classification have shown that the training process can be efficiently conducted. However, when the data size exceeds the memory capacity, most training methods suffer from very slow convergence due to the severe disk swapping. Although some methods have attempted to handle such a situation, they are usually too complicated to support some important functions such as parameter selection. In this paper, we introduce a block minimization framework for data larger than memory. Under the framework, a solver splits data into blocks and stores them into separate files. Then, at each time, the solver trains a data block loaded from disk. Although the framework is simple, the experimental results show that it effectively handles a data set 20 times larger than the memory capacity.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
My work focuses on building computational agents that assist people in managing their activities in environments in which tempo and complexity outstrip people’s cognitive capacity,such as in coordinating rescue teams in the aftermath of a disaster, or in helping people with dementia manage their everyday lives. A critical challenge faced in such environments is not only that individuals must factor complicated constraints into deciding how and when to act on their own goals, but also that their decisions are further constrained by choices made by others with whom they interact, such as between cooperating teams in disaster relief or between patients and caregivers in an assisted-living facility. An additional challenge in such situations is that the interests of individuals, such as privacy and autonomy, along with slow, costly, uncertain,or otherwise problematic communication may further limitindividuals’ abilities to work together. My work assumes that a computational agent is associated with each individual, and that these agents will work together efficiently to manage individual and joint activities, while maintaining autonomy and privacy to the extent possible.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Behaviour recognition aims to infer the particular behaviours of the inhabitant in a smart home from a series of sensor readings from around the house. There are many reasons to recognise human behaviours; one being to monitor the elderly or cognitively impaired and detect potentially dangerous behaviours. We view the behaviour recognition problem as the task of mapping the sensory outputs to a sequence of recognised activities. This research focuses on the development of machine learning methods to find an approximation to the mapping between sensor outputs and behaviours. However, learning the mapping raises an important issue, which is that the training data is not necessarily annotated with exemplar behaviours of the inhabitant. This doctoral study takes several steps towards addressing the problem of finding an approximation to this mapping, beginning with separate investigations on current methods proposed in the literature, identifying useful sensory outputs for behaviour recognition, and concluding by proposing two directions: one using supervised learning on annotated sensory stream and one using unsupervised learning on unannotated ones.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One of the main research problems in Structural Bioinformatics is the analysis and prediction of three-dimensional structures (3-D) of polypeptides or proteins. The 1990’s Genome projects resulted in a large increase in the number of protein sequences. However, the number of identified 3-D protein structures has not followed the same trend.The determination of protein structure is experimentally expensive and time consuming. This makes scientists largely dependent on computational methods that can predict correct 3-D protein structures only from extended and full amino acid sequences. Several computational methodologies and algorithms have been proposed as a solution to the Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem. We briefly describe the AI techniques we have been used to tackle this problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, the use of social and human computing has witnessed increasing interest in the AI community. However, in order to harness the true potential of social computing, human subjects must play an active role in achieving computation in social networks and related media. Our work proposes an initial desiderata for effective social computing, drawing inspiration from artificial intelligence. Extensive experimentation reveals that several open issues and research questions have to be answered before the true potential of social and human computing is achieved. We, however, take a somewhat novel approach, by implementing a social networks environment where human subjects cooperate towards computational problem solving. In our social environment, human and artificial agents cooperate in their computation tasks,which may lead to a single problem-solving social network that potentially allows seamless cooperation among human and machine agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) defines the research regarding robots which provide assistance to users through social interaction. Socially assistive robots are being studied for therapeutic use with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It has been observed that children with ASD interact with robots differently than with people or toys. This may indicate an intrinsic interest in such machines, which could be applied as a robot augmentation for an intervention for children with ASD. Preliminary studies suggest that robots may act as intrinsically-rewarding social partners for children with autism. However, enabling a robot to understand social behavior, and do so while interacting with the child, is a challenging problem. Children are highly individual and thus technology used for social interaction requires recognition of a wide-range of social behavior. This work addresses the challenge of designing behaviors for socially assistive robots in order to enable them to recognize and appropriately respond to a child’s free-form behavior in unstructured play contexts. The focus on free-form behavior is inspired by and grounded in existing approaches to therapeutic intervention with children with ASD. This model emphasizes creating circles of communication and fostering engagement through play. A key aspect of this approach is to recognize social behavior and use “engagements” to bolster social interaction behavior, and to study the ethical implications of therapeutic robotics applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithm is state-of-the-art for computing strategies in large games and other sequential decision-making problems. Little is known, however, about CFR in games with more than 2 players. This extended abstract outlines research towards a better understanding of CFR in multiplayer games and new procedures for computing even stronger multiplayer strategies. We summarize work already completed that investigates techniques for creating "expert" strategies for playing smaller sub-games, and work that proves CFR avoids classes of undesirable strategies. In addition, we provide an outline of our future research direction. Our goals are to apply regret minimization to the problem of playing multiple games simultaneously, and augment CFR to achieve effective on-line opponent modelling of multiple opponents. The objective of this research is to build a world-class computer poker player for multiplayer Limit Texas Hold'em.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Quantitative prediction problems involving both spatial and temporal components have appeared prominently in several disparate research areas including finance, supply chain management, and civil engineering. Unfortunately, either the spatial or temporal aspect tends to dominate the other in many prediction formulations. We briefly examine the underlying formulations used in spatial and temporal prediction. Then, we outline a method that combines these approaches and improves prediction results in high-dimensional economic domains by integrating multivariate and time series techniques which require minimal tuning but achieve superior performance compared to previous methods. We present preliminary results in the context of the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management.</p>

Model checking is one of the most effective techniques in automated system verification. Although this technique can handle complex verifications, model checking tools usually do not give any suggestions on how to repair inconsistent system models. In this paper, we show that approaches developed to update models of Computation Tree Logic (CTL) cannot deal with all kinds of changes. We introduce the concept of CTL model revision: an approach based on belief revision to handle system inconsistency in a static context.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
My research proposes to speed up grid-based pathfinding by identifying and eliminating symmetric path segments from the search space. Two paths are said to be symmetric if they are identical save for the order in which the individual moves (or steps) occur. To deal with path symmetries I decompose an arbitrary grid map into a set of empty rectangles and remove from each rectangle all interior nodes and possibly some from along the perimeter. A series of macro edges are then added between selected pairs of remaining nodes in order to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each rectangle. The new algorithm, Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR), can speed up A* search by up to 38 times on a range of uniform cost maps taken from the literature. In addition to being fast and optimal, RSR requires no significant extra memory and is largely orthogonal all existing speedup techniques. When compared to the state of the art, RSR often shows significant improvement across a range of benchmarks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In heterogeneous multi-agent systems trust is necessary to improve interactions by enabling agents to choose good partners. Most trust models work by taking, in addition to direct experiences, other agents' communicated evaluations into account. However, in an open MAS other agents may use different trust models and the evaluations they communicate are based on different principles: as such they are meaningless without some form of alignment. My doctoral research gives a formal definition of this problem and proposes two methods of achieving an alignment.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There are many significant research projects focused on providing semantic web repositories that are scalable and efficient. However, the true value of the semantic web architecture is its ability to represent meaningful knowledge and not just data. Therefore, a semantic web knowledge base should do more than retrieve collections of triples. We propose RDFKB (Resource Description Knowledge Base), a complete semantic web knowledge case. RDFKB is a solution for managing, persisting and querying semantic web knowledge. Our experiments with real world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that RDFKB achieves superior query performance to other state-of-the-art solutions. The key features of RDFKB that differentiate it from other solutions are: 1) a simple and efficient process for data additions, deletions and updates that does not involve reprocessing the dataset; 2) materialization of inferred triples at addition time without performance degradation; 3) materialization of uncertain information and support for queries involving probabilities; 4) distributed inference across datasets; 5) ability to apply alignments to the dataset and perform queries against multiple sources using alignment. RDFKB allows more knowledge to be stored and retrieved; it is a repository not just for RDF datasets, but also for inferred triples, probability information, and lineage information. RDFKB provides a complete and efficient RDF data repository and knowledge base.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, I present my ongoing research on temporal defeasible argumentation-based multi-agent planning. In multi-agent planning a team of agents share a set of goals but have diverse abilities and temporal beliefs, which vary over time. In order to plan for these goals, agents start a stepwise dialogue consisting of exchanges of temporal plan proposals, plus temporal arguments against them, where both, actions with different duration, and temporal defeasible arguments, need to be integrated. This thesis proposes a computational framework for this research on multi-agent planning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs) are a model for representing multi-agent systems in which agents cooperate to optimize a global objective. The DCOP model has two main advantages: it can represent a wide range of problem domains, and it supports the development of generic algorithms to solve them. Firstly, this paper presents some advances in both complete and approximate DCOP algorithms. Secondly, it explains that the DCOP model makes a number of unrealistic assumptions that severely limit its range of application. Finally, it points out hints on how to tackle such limitations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this proposal, we introduce Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALP), a probabilistic logic that adapts Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs) for abductive reasoning. Like BLPs, BALPs also combine first-order logic and Bayes nets. However, unlike BLPs, which use deduction to construct Bayes nets, BALPs employ logical abduction. As a result, BALPs are more suited for problems like plan/activity recognition that require abductive reasoning. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of BALPs, we apply it to two abductive reasoning tasks — plan recognition and natural language understanding.</p>

Broadly speaking, my research concerns combining logic of action and POMDP theory in a coherent, theoretically sound language for agent programming. We have already developed a logic for specifying partially observable stochastic domains. A logic for reasoning with the models specified must still be developed. An agent programming language will then be developed and used to design controllers for robots.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
For my thesis work I am developing a method for evaluating and standardizing ontologies based on an integration of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and OntoClean. BFO serves as the upper ontology for the domain ontologies of the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry. The OBO Foundry initiative is a collaborative effort for developing interoperable, science-based ontologies. OntoClean is an approach for the quality assurance of ontologies, and helps a modeler detect when the subsumption relation is used improperly. Ontologies developed for OBO use include some that have been ratified, and others holding the status of “candidate”. To maintain consistency between ontologies, it is important to establish formal principled criteria that a candidate ontology must meet for ratification. The formalisms that result from our integration will serve as criteria an OBO Foundry candidate ontology must satisfy in order to be ratified. The formalisms will also serve as a constraints within a prototype of an ontology editor that interactively asks a modeler questions that helps alleviate constraint violations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The development of service robots has gained more and more attention over the last years. Advanced robots have to cope with many different situations and contingencies while executing concurrent and interruptable complex tasks. To manage the sheer variety of different execution variants the robot has to decide at run-time for the most appropriate behavior to execute. That requires task coordination mechanisms that provide the flexibility to adapt at run-time and allow to balance between alternatives.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A baby experiencing the world for the first time faces a considerable challenging sorting through what William James called the "blooming, buzzing confusion" of the senses. With the increasing capacity of modern sensors and the complexity of modern robot bodies, a robot in an unknown or unfamiliar body faces a similar and equally daunting challenge. Addressing this challenge directly by designing robot agents capable of resolving the confusion of sensory experience in an autonomous manner would substantially reduce the engineering required to program robots and the improve the robustness of resulting robot capabilities. Working towards a general solution to this problem, this work uses distinctive state abstractions and sensorimotor embedding to generate basic knowledge of sensor structure, local geometry, and object geometry starting with uninterpreted sensors and effectors.</p>

I introduce a learning from demonstration system, called Hierarchical Training of Agent Behavior (HITAB). In HITAB, agents learn a hierarchical finite state automata (HFA) represented as a Moore machine where individual states correspond to agent behaviors or another HFA. HITAB allows rapid training of both single agent and multiagent behaviors.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Heuristic search is a central component of many important applications in AI including automated planning. While we can find optimal solutions to heuristic search problems, doing so may take hours or days. For practical applications, this is unacceptably slow, and we must rely on algorithms which find solutions of high, but not optimal, quality or ones which bound the time used directly. In my dissertation, I present and analyze algorithms for the following settings: quality bounded heuristic search and time bounded heuristic search. The central theme of my doctoral work will be that taking advantage of additional information can improve the performance of heuristic search algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Planning under uncertainty is one of the most general and hardest problems considered in the area of planning. Uncertainty can take the form of incomplete information, wrong information, multiple action outcomes, and varying action durations. My doctoral thesis concentrates on planning with incomplete knowledge and multiple action outcomes, specifically conformant planning and contingent planning. These problems have attracted the attention of many researchers, resulting in numerous sophisticated planners of different approaches. However, those planners cannot scale up well on the size of problems, mostly due to the representation methods employed in the planners. The doctoral research work provides a systematic methodology for dealing with planning under uncertainty, focusing on the representation of belief states that can be used in a forward search paradigm in the belief space for solutions. A good representation should be compact so that a planner implementing it can perform and scale up well as the larger the formulae, the more the computation and the more the memory consumption (i.e., the slower the system and the less the scalability). On the other hand, it should also have properties that allow for definition of an efficient transition function for computing successor belief states, e.g., checking satisfaction in a DNF formula is easy. Defining a direct complete transition function in presence of incomplete information for a general representation, other than the belief state, is particularly hard due to conditional action effects. To address this, I propose a generic abstract algorithm, called GAA, for defining such function given an arbitrary representation. Using the GAA algorithm, my doctoral thesis investigates the properties of different logical formulae and their applicability in planning under uncertainty as a belief state representation. The results obtained so far are very promissing as the research work developed several highly competitive planners which outperform other state-of-the-art planners in most benchmarks available in the literature.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multi-agent path planning is a challenging problem with numerous real-life applications, including robotics, logistics, military operations planning, disaster rescue, and computer games. We look at navigating large numbers of mobile units to their targets on navigation graphs such as grid maps. The size of problems examined is significantly larger than can be handled using optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithms in practice. We introduced MAPP, a tractable algorithm for multi-agent path planning on undirected graphs. MAPP and its extended versions are complete on well specified and tractably testable classes of problems. They have low-polynomial worst-case upper bounds for the running time, the memory requirements, and the length of solutions. Experiments on realistic game grid maps, with uniformly randomly generated start and target locations for each unit, show MAPP as a state-of-the-art multi-agent pathfinding algorithm in terms of scalability and success ratio (i.e., percentage of solved units). Even on challenging scenarios with 2000 units, MAPP solves 92% to 99.7% of units. FAR and WHCA<em>, two fast but incomplete algorithms that were previously state-of-the-art in terms of scalability, solve as few as 17.5% and 12.3% of these problems. The quality of MAPP's solutions is empirically analyzed using multiple quality criteria: total travel distance, makespan, and sum of actions (including move and wait actions). MAPP is competitive in terms of solution quality and speed with FAR and WHCA</em>. MAPP further provides the formal characterizations that FAR and WHCA* lack, on problems it can solve as well as low-polynomial upper bounds on the resources required. As optimal algorithms have limited scalability, we evaluated the solution quality of suboptimal algorithms using lower bounds of optimal values. We showed that MAPP's solutions have a reasonable quality. For example, MAPP's total travel distance is on average 19% longer than a lower bound on the optimal value.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Imprecision and uncertainty in the large number of input parameters are serious problems in forest fire behaviour modelling. To obtain more reliable forecasts, fast and efficient computational input parameter estimation and calibration mechanisms should be integrated. These have to respect hard real-time constraints of simulations to prevent tragedy. We propose an Evolutionary Intelligent System (EIS) for parameter calibration. Depending on disaster size, required parameter precision, and available computing resources, the hybridisation of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with an intelligent paradigm (IP) can be configured. Experiments show that EIS generates comparable estimations to standard evolutionary calibration approaches, clearly outperforming the latter in runtime.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Previous work on transfer learning focused on adapting solutions in a base domain to problems with similiar features or structure in a new domain. Different techniques are required for domains where problems are qualitatively dissimilar in both features and structures. In this work, we examine how transfer learning might be accomplished in the domain of "tower defense" spatial reasoning puzzles. Using a combination of human studies and generative computer models, we show that transfer is possible in this domain by using a set of strategies, possibly in a novel combination, inferred from multiple base problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The most prominent way to establish trust in online markets such as eBay are reputation systems that publish buyer feedback about a seller's past behavior. These systems, however, critically rely on assumptions that are rarely met in real-world marketplaces: first, it is assumed that there are no reporting costs and no benefits from lying so that buyers honestly report their private experiences. Second, it is assumed that every seller is long-lived, i.e. will continue to trade on the marketplace indefinitely and, third, it is assumed that sellers cannot whitewash, i.e. create new accounts once an old one is ran down. In my thesis, I address all of these assumptions and design incentive-compatible trust mechanisms that do not rely on any of the aforementioned assumptions. Moreover, I focus on designs that minimize common knowledge assumptions with respect to the players' valuations, costs and beliefs.</p>
