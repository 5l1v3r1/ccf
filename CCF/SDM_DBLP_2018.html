<p>【Abstract】:
Let  and ' be finite partitions of the set V. Finding good correspondences between the parts of  and those of ' is helpful in classification, pattern recognition, and network analysis. Unlike common similarity measures for partitions that yield only a single value, we provide specifics on how  and ' correspond to each other. To this end, we first define natural collections of best correspondences under three constraints C˅, C, and C˄. In case of C˅, the best correspondences form a minimum cut basis of a certain bipartite graph, whereas the other two lead to minimum cut bases of  w. r. t. '. We also introduce a constraint, Cm, which tightens C˄; both are useful for finding consensus partitions. We then develop branch-and-bound algorithms for finding minimum Ps-Pt cuts of  and thus || — 1 best correspondences under C, C˄, and Cm, respectively. In a case study, we use the correspondences to gain insight into a community detection algorithm. The results suggest, among others, that only very minor losses in the quality of the correspondences occur if the branch-and-bound algorithm is restricted to its greedy core. Thus, even for graphs with more than half a million nodes and hundreds of communities, we can find hundreds of best or almost best correspondences in less than a minute.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we address the problem of recovering arbitrary-shaped data clusters from datasets while facing high space constraints, as this is for instance the case in many real-world applications when analysis algorithms are directly deployed on resources-limited mobile devices collecting the data. We present DBMSTClu a new space-efficient density-based non-parametric method working on a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) recovered from a limited number of linear measurements i.e. a sketched version of the dissimilarity graph  between the N objects to cluster. Unlike k-means, k-medians or k-medoids algorithms, it does not fail at distinguishing clusters with particular forms thanks to the property of the MST for expressing the underlying structure of a graph. No input parameter is needed contrarily to DBSCAN or the Spectral Clustering method. An approximate MST is retrieved by following the dynamic semi-streaming model in handling the dissimilarity graph  as a stream of edge weight updates which is sketched in one pass over the data into a compact structure requiring O(N polylog(N)) space, far better than the theoretical memory cost O(N2) of . The recovered approximate MST  as input, DBMSTClu then successfully detects the right number of nonconvex clusters by performing relevant cuts on  in a time linear in N. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the clustering partition and also demonstrate its advantage over the existing state-of-the-art on several datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Blockmodelling is an important technique for detecting underlying patterns in graphs. However, existing blockmodelling algorithms do not provide the user with any explicit control to specify which patterns might be of interest. Furthermore, existing algorithms focus on finding standard community structures in graphs, and are likely to overlook informative but more complex patterns, such as hierarchical or ring blockmodel structures. In this paper, we propose a generic constraint programming framework for blockmodelling, which allows a user to specify and search for complex blockmodel patterns in graphs. Our proposed framework can be incorporated into existing iterative blockmodelling algorithms, operating as a hybrid optimization scheme that provides high flexibility and expressiveness. We demonstrate the power of our framework for discovering complex patterns, via experiments over a range of synthetic and real data sets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is one of the most effective algorithms for subspace clustering. Exploring the multiple subspace structures of data such as Low-Rank Representation is effective in subspace clustering. Low-Rank Representation is usually formulated as a constrained convex optimization problem regularized with nuclear norm. It needs singular values decomposition (SVD) in every iteration which is challenging in terms of time complexity and memory. Recently, its non-convex formulation, NLRR [1] via matrix factorization framework has been proposed, and becomes one of state-of-the-art techniques for subspace clustering. However, NLRR cannot scale to problems with large n (number of samples) since it requires either the inversion of an n × n matrix or solving an n × n linear system. In this paper, we develop a faster algorithm for solving NLRR problem, with time complexity per iteration reduced from (n3) to (mnd) and memory complexity from (n2) to (mn), where m is dimensionality and d is the target rank (usually d ≪ m ≪ n). The main idea of our algorithm is to reformulate NLRR as a sum of rank-one components and apply a column-wise block coordinate descent to update each component iteratively. Our new method is considerably faster and more accurate in practice for subspace clustering. We also show that the proposed method is guaranteed to converge to stationary points. Moreover, considering the high demand in memory and computational time for the final spectral clustering phase, we also propose an efficient clustering approach which can further boost the performance of subspace clustering. Experiments on extensive simulations and real datasets confirm the efficiency of our proposed NLRR++. In particular, we are more than 12 times faster than state-of-the-art subspace clustering method, NLRR, and our method is the only subspace clustering algorithm that can scale to the Imagenet dataset with 120K samples.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most conventional document categorization methods require a large number of documents with labeled categories for training. These methods are hard to be applied in scenarios, such as scientific publications, where training data is expensive to obtain and categories could change over years and across domains. In this work, we propose UNEC, an unsupervised representation learning model that directly categories documents without the need of labeled training data. Specifically, we develop a novel cascade embedding approach. We first embed concepts, i.e., significant phrases mined from scientific publications, into continuous vectors, which capture concept semantics. Based on the concept similarity graph built from the concept embedding, we further embed concepts into a hidden category space, where the category information of concepts becomes explicit. Finally we categorize documents by jointly considering the category attribution of their concepts. Our experimental results show that UNEC significantly outperforms several strong baselines on a number of real scientific corpora, under both automatic and manual evaluation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Block models are a popular method for simplifying a single graph into a set of blocks and interactions between those blocks. A recent innovation is to extend block modeling to a collection of graphs (e.g. RESCAL) to discover one common block structure amongst the graphs. However, these approaches are unsuitable in many domains where the collection can comprise items from significantly different groups. Consider the focus of this paper: fMRI analysis on scans of young healthy and Alzheimer's affected individuals. There are implicitly two underlying block structures (one for each group) and some individuals may exhibit the behavior of both. We propose a novel mixtures of block models (MBM) framework that explicitly models each single graph as a linear combination of a small number of block models. Experimental results on synthetic data show that our method is able to recover the ground-truth models. In real-world experiments with fMRI data we show that with proper factorization parameters, MBM (1) outperforms the single block structure models and (2) demonstrates significant structural patterns of brain networks at the cohort level.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given two discrete valued time series—that is, event sequences—of length n can we tell whether they are causally related? That is, can we tell whether xn causes yn, whether yn causes xn? Can we do so without having to make assumptions on the distribution of these time series, or about the lag of the causal effect? And, importantly for practical application, can we do so accurately and efficiently? These are exactly the questions we answer in this paper. We propose a causal inference framework for event sequences based on information theory. We build upon the well-known notion of Granger causality, and define causality in terms of compression. We infer that xn is likely a cause of yn if yn can be (much) better sequentially compressed given the past of both yn and xn, than for the other way around. To compress the data we use the notion of sequential normalized maximal likelihood, which means we use minimax optimal codes with respect to a parametric family of distributions. To show this works in practice, we propose CUTE, a linear time method for inferring the causal direction between two event sequences. Empirical evaluation shows that CUTE works well in practice, is much more robust than transfer entropy, and ably reconstructs the ground truth on river flow and spike train data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The wide deployments of GPS-embedded devices have produced multiple rapid voluminous trajectory streams, which needs to be analyzed to extract abnormal behaviors of moving objects in real-time. To date, outlier detection over distributed trajectory streams has not received enough focuses due to the constraint factors like skewness distribution and evolving nature of trajectory data, and on-the-fly execution requirement with minimal communication cost. In this paper, we present the first scalable decentralized outlier detection framework over distributed trajectory streams, called ODDTS. It consists of remote site processing and coordinator processing, with the aim of continuously providing feature-grouping based outliers detection over distributed trajectory streams. Extensive experiments over real data demonstrate high detecting validity, less communication cost and linear scalability of ODDTS method for online identifying outliers upon distributed trajectory streams.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we address a classical sequence mining problem, namely, that of finding the Closest Pair of Subsequences. Given a sequence A of length n, the problem is to identify two non-overlapping subsequences of length l each in A, such that their distance is minimum from among all such pairs. This is a fundamental problem that has a wide range of applications such as time series data mining, sequence data pattern matching, data signature identification, biological motif mining, metagenomic clustering, etc. To solve this problem, the state-of-the-art algorithm takes advantage of the overlapping parts of consecutive subsequences. By exploiting these overlaps, researchers have developed an algorithm with a run time of O(n2), which is independent of the dimension l. In this paper, we propose a deterministic algorithm called JUMP, which further pushes the limit by skipping unnecessary comparisons and multiplication operations, and improves the running time by a large factor. We have performed extensive experiments using standard benchmark datasets, and found that JUMP outperforms existing O(n2) methods by a factor of up to 100. Our experiments cover different settings of n and l and provide the readers a comprehensive and unbiased comparison under different conditions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Sparse tensor factorization is a popular tool in multi-way data analysis and is used in applications such as cybersecurity, recommender systems, and social network analysis. In many of these applications, the tensor is not known a priori and instead arrives in a streaming fashion for a potentially unbounded amount of time. Existing approaches for streaming sparse tensors are not practical for unbounded streaming because they rely on maintaining the full factorization of the data, which grows linearly with time. In this work, we present CP-stream, an algorithm for streaming factorization in the model of the canonical polyadic decomposition which does not grow linearly in time or space, and is thus practical for long-term streaming. Additionally, CP-stream incorporates user-specified constraints such as non-negativity which aid in the stability and interpretability of the factorization. An evaluation of CP-stream demonstrates that it converges faster than state-of-the-art streaming algorithms while achieving lower reconstruction error by an order of magnitude. We also evaluate it on real-world sparse datasets and demonstrate its usability in both network traffic analysis and discussion tracking. Our evaluation uses exclusively public datasets and our source code is released to the public as part of SPLATT, an open source high-performance tensor factorization toolkit.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Finding patterns in long event sequences is an important data mining task. Two decades ago research focused on finding all frequent patterns, where the anti-monotonic property of support was used to design efficient algorithms. Recent research focuses on producing a smaller output containing only the most interesting patterns. To achieve this goal, we introduce a new interestingness measure by computing the proportion of the occurrences of a pattern that are cohesive. This measure is robust to outliers, and is applicable to sequential patterns. We implement an efficient algorithm based on constrained prefix-projected pattern growth and pruning based on an upper bound to uncover the set of top-k quantile-based cohesive sequential patterns. We run experiments to compare our method with existing state-of-the-art methods for sequential pattern mining and show that our algorithm is efficient and produces qualitatively interesting patterns on large event sequences.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Large-scale societal events such as civil unrest movements occur due to a variety of factors including economics, politics, and security. Societal event detection can be modeled as a system of inter-connected locations, where each location is recording a set of time-dependent observations. In order to detect event occurrence and automatically reconstruct the precursors and signals, it is essential to model relationships between the different locations w.r.t. how events evolve over time. However, existing methods for precursor discovery do not capture or exploit spatial and temporal correlations inherent in event occurrences. The absence of such modeling not only creates shortcomings in the quality of inference but also curtails interpretation by human analysts. Furthermore, forecasting is inhibited when training data is sparse. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-task model with dynamic graph constraints within a multi-instance learning framework. Our model tackles the problem of scarce data distribution and reinforces co-occurring location-specific precursors with augmented representations. Through studies on civil unrest movements in numerous countries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for precursor discovery and event forecasting.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many applications, such as the Internet and infrastructure networks, nodes fail or get congested dynamically. We study the problem of inferring all the failed nodes, when only a sample of the failures is known, and there exist correlations between node failures/congestion in networks. We formalize this as the GraphStateInf problem, using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We propose the GraphMap algorithm for minimizing the MDL cost, and show that it gives an additive approximation, relative to the optimal. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real datasets, which includes one from WAZE which gives traffic incident reports for the city of Boston. We find that our method gives promising results in recovering the missing failures.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are a popular tool for exploring conditional dependence among high dimensional data. We consider developing an estimator for GGMs for multiple graph analysis, wherein the graphs are assumed to come from two (or more) contrastive groups, and exhibit not only major global similarity, but also substantial between-group disparity. Under this setting, inferring each group of networks separately ignores the common structure, while simply assuming a global common network structure would mask the critical disparity. We propose a novel approach to pursue simultaneous network inference using discriminative and adaptive structural regularizations. We introduce a heterogeneity ratio parameter to balance the within group similarity and the between group disparity. This formulation for the first time, to our knowledge, generalizes the existing single-group network analysis to multiple-group network analysis. In other words, our proposed multiple-group network analysis reduces to single-group network analysis, when the heterogeneity ratio equal to 1. By iteratively updating a global regularization template with individual network structures, together with a feature screening module specifying relevant dimensions to satisfy the group-level constraints, our generalized approach can recover the underlying conditional independence with greater flexibility and improved accuracy. Theoretically, we show the asymptotic consistency for the proposed method in joint reconstruction of multiple network structures. We demonstrate its superior performance via extensive simulation studies. We also illustrate its practical usage in an application to polychromatic flow cytometry data sets for protein interactions under different conditions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Network centrality plays an important role in many applications. Central nodes in social networks can be influential, driving opinions and spreading news or rumors. In hyperlinked environments, such as the Web, where users navigate via clicks, central content receives high traffic, becoming target for advertising campaigns. While there is an extensive amount of work on centrality measures and their efficient computation, controlling nodes' centrality via network updates is a more recent and challenging task. Performing minimal modifications to a network to achieve a desired property falls under the umbrella of network design problems. This paper is focused on improving group (coverage and betweenness) centrality, which is a function of the shortest paths passing through a set of nodes, by adding edges to the network. Several variations of the problem, which are NP-hard as well as APX-hard, are introduced. We present a greedy algorithm, and even faster sampling algorithms, for group centrality maximization with theoretical quality guarantees under realistic constraints. The experimental results show that our sampling algorithms outperform the best baseline solution in terms of centrality by up to 5 times while being 2–3 orders of magnitude faster than our greedy approach.</p>

In this paper we address the challenge of inferring the road network of a city from crowd-sourced GPS traces. While the problem has been addressed before, our solution has the following unique characteristics: (i) we formulate the road network inference problem as a network alignment optimization problem where both the nodes and edges of the network have to be inferred, (ii) we propose both an offline (Kharita) and an online (Kharita) algorithm which are intuitive and capture the key aspects of the optimization formulation but are scalable and accurate. The Kharita in particular is, to the best of our knowledge, the first known online algorithm for map inference, (iii) we test our approach on two real data sets and both our code and data sets have been made available for research reproducibility.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Due to the heterogeneity in HINs, the typed edges may not fully align with each other. In order to capture the semantic subtlety, we propose the concept of aspects with each aspect being a unit representing one underlying semantic facet. Meanwhile, network embedding has emerged as a powerful method for learning network representation, where the learned embedding can be used as features in various downstream applications. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a novel embedding learning framework—AspEm—to preserve the semantic information in HINs based on multiple aspects. Instead of preserving information of the network in one semantic space, AspEm encapsulates information regarding each aspect individually. In order to select aspects for embedding purpose, we further devise a solution for AspEm based on dataset-wide statistics. To corroborate the efficacy of AspEm, we conducted experiments on two real-words datasets with two types of applications—classification and link prediction. Experiment results demonstrate that AspEm can outperform baseline network embedding learning methods by considering multiple aspects, where the aspects can be selected from the given HIN in an unsupervised manner.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Semi-supervised Embedding in Attributed Networks with Outliers (SEANO), to learn a low-dimensional vector representation that systematically captures the topological proximity, attribute affinity and label similarity of vertices in a partially labeled attributed network (PLAN). Our method is designed to work in both transductive and inductive settings while explicitly alleviating noise effects from outliers. Experimental results on various datasets drawn from the web, text and image domains demonstrate the advantages of SEANO over the state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised classification under transductive as well as inductive settings. We also show that a subset of parameters in SEANO are interpretable as outlier scores and can significantly outperform baseline methods when applied for detecting network outliers. Finally, we present the use of SEANO in a challenging real-world setting – flood mapping of satellite images and show that it is able to outperform modern remote sensing algorithms for this task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Truth discovery, with the goal of inferring true information from massive data through aggregating the information from multiple data sources, has attracted significant attention in recent years. It has demonstrated great advantages in real applications since it can automatically learn the reliability degrees of the data sources without supervision and in turn helps to find more reliable information. In many applications, however, the data may arrive in a stream and present various temporal patterns. Unfortunately, there is no existing truth discovery work that can handle such time series data. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel online truth discovery framework that incorporates the predictions on the time series data into the truth estimation process. By jointly considering the multi-source information and the temporal patterns of the time series data, the proposed framework can improve the accuracy of the truth discovery results as well as the time series prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Bike-Sharing Systems (BSSs) are being introduced to more and more cities recently, and therefore they have generated huge amounts of data. Mobike is a station-less BSS which is suffering from the chaotic parking problem. To solve this problem, it is necessary to predict where the bikes are going. Traditional works dealing with destination prediction mainly focus on station-based BSSs, and they merely leverages context-aware information technically. Thus it is naturally promising to investigate how to improve the destination prediction of station-less bikes by context information. To that end, in this paper, we develop a multi-view machine (MVM) method, by incorporating the context information from Point of Interest (POI) data and human mobility data into destination prediction. Specifically, we first describe three different views, namely start position, start time and destination by features extracted from POI data and human mobility data. Then, we capture the relationship between these three views' interactions and the trip's possibility by a multi-view machine. Finally, since multi-view machine contains too many parameters to be optimized, we leverage tensor factorization (TF) to reduce the computation costs. The experimental results show that the model can effectively capture the potential relationship of three views with trip's possibility and the approach is thus much more effective than traditional prediction methods for destination.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Event-based social network (EBSN) services have emerged as a new platform on which users can choose events of interest to attend in the physical world. Over years, there are growing research interests in predicting whether certain actors will participate in an event together. In this work, we refer to this task as the event attendance prediction problem and aim to address the predictability of individuals' event attendance. In real-world settings, the factors that influence an individual's attendance may change over time, leading to the dynamic nature of individuals' behavior. However, existing event attendance prediction methods cannot deal with such dynamic scenarios. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Deep Event Attendance Prediction (DEAP) framework—a three-level hierarchical LSTM architecture—to explicitly model users' multi-dimensional and evolving preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DEAP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques across various settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Understanding the linkability of online user identifiers (IDs) is critical to both service providers (for business intelligence) and individual users (for assessing privacy risks). Existing methods are designed to match IDs across two services, but face key challenges of matching multiple services in practice, particularly when users have multiple IDs per service. In this paper, we propose a novel system to link IDs across multiple services by exploring the spatial-temporal locality of user activities. The core idea is that the same user's online IDs are more likely to repeatedly appear at the same location. Specifically, we first utilize a contact graph to capture the “co-location” of all IDs across multiple services. Based on this graph, we propose a set-wise matching algorithm to discover candidate ID sets, and use Bayesian inference to generate confidence scores for candidate ranking, which is proved to be optimal. We evaluate our system using two real-world ground-truth datasets from an ISP (4 services, 815K IDs) and Twitter-Foursquare (2 services, 770 IDs). Extensive results show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy (AUC is higher by 0.1–0.2), and it is highly robust against matching order and number of services.</p>

Micro-video has recently become an important form of user generated contents in the social media of microblogging. It is propagated by sharing and reaches the other users through being clicked and watched. Besides the traditional popularity metric for a micro-video such as click (or view) count, share count can indicate its virality in social domain. Understanding the differences between clicking and sharing behaviors is fundamental when evaluating the actual influence of micro-videos in social media. However, since that click data is usually not public available, above question has not been investigated in most studies. Thanks to a massive set of anonymized data from a major operator covering the whole China, we jointly study both clicking and sharing behaviors of over 10,000 micro-videos in Sina Weibo, the largest microblogging service and micro-video platform in China. Having extracted a rich set of features covering micro-video publishers, description texts and those shared users, we are able to identify the most influential features for click and share. From our studies, we observe that publisher-related features (post and followee counts) as well as the video duration have more impact on click, while video-description-related features including topical features and emoticon count are more correlated to share. Impacted by different features, the received clicks and shares of a micro-video may differ a lot from each other. Based on above observations, we build a prediction model for existing deviations among these two metrics, which can aid the development of a more effective and attractive micro-video platform.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Traffic congestion in developing cities like Nairobi, Kenya can be significantly impacted by the presence of Moving Traffic Obstacles (MTOs). These MTOs are events that temporarily exist on the road, moving with or against the direction of traffic at slower speeds. They include two-wheelers, pushcarts, animals, and pedestrians, which have quite different influence on traffic compared with static obstacles, such as potholes and speed bumps. As smartphones and supporting 3G infrastructures are wide spread even in developing countries, recent studies enabled frugal traffic obstacle data collection from smartphones in probe cars. Assuming the opportunistic, unevenly-distributed, sparse and errorful observation of traffic obstacles, we propose an MTO detection algorithm extending an image analysis technique called Probabilistic Hough Transform for collective observations as input. Based on our experiences with a small set of real-world data collected in a smartphone-based probe car project with Nairobi City County, we conducted experiments with simulated observation data to see the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Understanding heterogeneous multivariate time series data is important in many applications ranging from smart homes to aviation. Learning models of heterogeneous multivariate time series that are also human-interpretable is challenging and not adequately addressed by the existing literature. We propose grammar-based decision trees (GBDTs) and an algorithm for learning them. GBDTs extend decision trees with a grammar framework. Logical expressions derived from a context-free grammar are used for branching in place of simple thresholds on attributes. The added expressivity enables support for a wide range of data types while retaining the interpretability of decision trees. In particular, when a grammar based on temporal logic is used, we show that GBDTs can be used for the interpretable classification of high-dimensional and heterogeneous time series data. Furthermore, we show how GBDTs can also be used for categorization, which is a combination of clustering and generating interpretable explanations for each cluster. We apply GBDTs to analyze the classic Australian Sign Language dataset as well as data on near mid-air collisions (NMACs). The NMAC data comes from aircraft simulations used in the development of the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS X).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Time series classification maps time series to labels. The nearest neighbor algorithm (NN) using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure is a leading algorithm for this task and a component of the current best ensemble classifiers for time series. However, NN-DTW is only a winning combination when its meta-parameter – its warping window – is learned from the training data. The warping window (WW) intuitively controls the amount of distortion allowed when comparing a pair of time series. With a training database of N time series of lengths L, a naive approach to learning the WW requires Θ(N2·L3) operations. This often results in NN-DTW requiring days for training on datasets containing a few thousand time series only. In this paper, we introduce FastWWSearch: an efficient and exact method to learn WW. We show on 86 datasets that our method is always faster than the state of the art, with at least one order of magnitude and up to 1000x speed-up.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Similarity search is arguably the most important primitive in time series data mining. It is useful in its own right as an exploratory tool, and a subroutine in almost all higher level algorithms, such as motif discovery, anomaly detection, classification, clustering and summarization. Because of this, and the prevalence of time series data, the last decade has seen fast algorithms for time series similarity search under Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Uniform Scaling (US) distance measures. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms for US have only been demonstrated for the modest amounts of rescaling in datasets produced by human behaviors such as gestures, speech, music performance and physiological measurements such as heartbeats and respiration. As we shall show, in many industrial and commercial contexts we may encounter much greater amounts of rescaling, rendering current solutions little better than brute force search. To mitigate this problem we introduce novel lower bounds, LBnew, which, for the first time allows efficient search even in domains that exhibit more than a factor-of-two variability in scale. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both theoretical guarantees and comprehensive experiments on real data from commercial important domains, including power consumption monitoring and ECG monitoring. The results show the application of our lower bounds significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for accelerating similarity searching of time series with more than a factor-of-two variability in scale as well as high-level time series mining tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The mining of time series data has attracted much attention in the past two decades due to the ubiquity of time series in our daily lives. In particular, classification is perhaps one of the most well-studied topics for time series data. Many state-of-the-art classification techniques work by identifying and extracting patterns or characteristics from the training data, and then applying these patterns or characteristics to classify unlabeled time series. This paper presents a novel finding that sequences of values that are very different from the patterns in the labeled time series can be used as references to classify time series effectively. We propose an evolution process to generate these sequences of values, which we call separating references, from the training data. The proposed method is robust to over-fitting and is especially suitable for the situation where little labeled data is available. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly competitive on the well-known UCR time series classification benchmarks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Time series classification algorithms designed to use local context do not work on landcover classification problems where the instances of the two classes may often exhibit similar feature values due to the large natural variations in other land covers across the year and unrelated phenomena that they undergo. In this paper, we propose to learn discriminative patterns from the entire length of the time series, and use them as predictive features to identify the class of interest. We propose a novel neural network algorithm to learn the key signature of the class of interest as a function of the feature values together with the discriminative pattern made from that signature through the entire time series in a joint framework. We demonstrate the utility of this technique on the landcover classification application of burned area mapping that is of considerable societal importance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Leveraging massive electronic health records (EHR) brings tremendous promises to advance clinical and precision medicine informatics research. However, it is very challenging to directly work with multifaceted patient information encoded in their EHR data. Deriving effective representations of patient EHRs is a crucial step to bridge raw EHR information and the endpoint analytical tasks, such as risk prediction or disease subtyping. In this paper, we propose Health-ATM, a novel and integrated deep architecture to uncover patients' comprehensive health information from their noisy, longitudinal, heterogeneous and irregular EHR data. Health-ATM extracts comprehensive multifaceted patient information patterns with attentive and time-aware modulars (ATM) and a hybrid network structure composed of both Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The learned features are finally fed into a prediction layer to conduct the risk prediction task. We evaluated the Health-ATM on both artificial and real world EHR corpus and demonstrated its promising utility and efficacy on representation learning and disease onset predictions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Patient similarity learning aims to derive a clinically meaningful similarity metric to measure the similarity between a pair of patients according to their historical clinical information, which could help to predict the clinical outcomes of the patient of interest. However, the patient clinical data are usually complex, and contain much irrelevant and redundant information, which makes it difficult to learn the similarity metric with high accuracy. Although some methods have been proposed to address the complex nature of patient data, they overemphasize sparsity-based relevant feature selection and fail to take into consideration the redundant features that are highly correlated with each other, and this heavily degrades the accuracy of the learned results. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel uncorrelated patient similarity learning approach, which can not only select the most relevant features for the learning task, but also guarantee that the selected features have low correlations with each other. Additionally, to address the scenarios where the patient data are distributed across different sites, we extend the proposed approach and design a distributed mechanism, based on which the similarity metric can be accurately learned without directly accessing the raw patient data at each site. The desirable performance of the proposed methods are verified through extensive experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recognition of human intention based on Electroencephalography (EEG) signals attracts strong research interest in pattern recognition because of its promising applications that enable non-muscular communications and controls. Over the past few years, most EEG-based recognition works make significant efforts to learn extracted features to explore specific patterns between a segment of EEG signals and the corresponding activities. Unfortunately, vectorization-based feature representations, either vector-like or matrix-like ones, suffer from massive signal noise and difficulties of exploiting signal correlations between adjacent sensors of EEG signals. Most importantly, EEG signals are represented by one unique frequency and then fed into the subsequent learning model. Neglecting different frequencies of EEG signals can be detrimental to activity recognition because a particular frequency of EEG signals is more helpful to recognize some activities. Inspired by this idea, we propose to extract EEG signals with different frequencies and introduce a novel Multi-task deep learning model to learn the human intentions. We have conducted extensive experiments on a publicly available EEG benchmark dataset and compared our method with many state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-task deep recurrent neural network outperforms all the compared methods in a multi-class scenario.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
There are many major diseases that remain incurable, e.g., cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, the prevention for these diseases has more impact than diagnosis and treatment. Survival analysis aims at predicting the time of occurrence of specific events of interest. It can be used to identify patients of high risk, which helps healthcare system to effectively allocate limited medical resources. In many real-world applications, such as healthcare analysis, a lot of datasets are collected from multiple data sources and exhibit a block-wise missing pattern, i.e., each patient takes different types of tests and receives various treatments, and each test/treatment associates with a corresponding set of features. However, all the existing survival analysis methods are designed for fully observed datasets and may not be directly applied when such block-wise missing presented. The proposed work in this paper aims at addressing aforementioned research challenges. Specifically, we employ a partition method that decomposes the multi-source block-wise missing data into the multiple completed sub-matrix; thus, transforms the original problem into a series of related multi-source survival analysis problems. To deal with these problems, we propose a two-layer multi-task learning model that achieves both feature-level and source-level analysis, and the proposed model is able to take advantage of the structure information in the block-wise missing pattern. We apply the proposed method in a real-world AD dataset to study the stage conversion of AD patients. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Optimization of patient throughput and wait time in emergency departments (ED) is an important task for hospital systems. For that reason, Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system for patient triage was introduced to help guide manual estimation of acuity levels, which is used by nurses to rank the patients and organize hospital resources. However, despite improvements that it brought to managing medical resources, such triage system greatly depends on nurse's subjective judgment and is thus prone to human errors. Here, we propose a novel deep model based on the word attention mechanism designed for predicting a number of resources an ED patient would need. Our approach incorporates routinely available continuous and nominal (structured) data with medical text (unstructured) data, including patient's chief complaint, past medical history, medication list, and nurse assessment collected for 338,500 ED visits over three years in a large urban hospital. Using both structured and unstructured data, the proposed approach achieves the AUC of ∼ 88% for the task of identifying resource intensive patients (binary classification), and the accuracy of ∼ 44% for predicting exact category of number of resources (multi-class classification task), giving an estimated lift over nurses' performance by 16% in accuracy. Furthermore, the attention mechanism of the proposed model provides interpretability by assigning attention scores for nurses' notes which is crucial for decision making and implementation of such approaches in the real systems working on human health.</p>

We propose a novel approach to learn distributed representation for graph data. Our idea is to combine a recently introduced neural document embedding model with a traditional pattern mining technique, by treating a graph as a document and frequent subgraphs as atomic units for the embedding process. Compared to the latest graph embedding methods, our proposed method offers three key advantages: fully unsupervised learning, entire-graph embedding, and edge label leveraging. We demonstrate our method on several datasets in comparison with a comprehensive list of up-to-date state-of-the-art baselines where we show its advantages for both classification and clustering tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Populating ontology graphs represents a long-standing problem for the Semantic Web community. Recent advances in translation-based graph embedding methods for populating instance-level knowledge graphs lead to promising new approaching for the ontology population problem. However, unlike instance-level graphs, the majority of relation facts in ontology graphs come with comprehensive semantic relations, which often include the properties of transitivity and symmetry, as well as hierarchical relations. These comprehensive relations are often too complex for existing graph embedding methods, and direct application of such methods is not feasible. Hence, we propose On2Vec, a novel translation-based graph embedding method for ontology population. On2Vec integrates two model components that effectively characterize comprehensive relation facts in ontology graphs. The first is the Component-specific Model that encodes concepts and relations into low-dimensional embedding spaces without a loss of relational properties; the second is the Hierarchy Model that performs focused learning of hierarchical relation facts. Experiments on several well-known ontology graphs demonstrate the promising capabilities of On2Vec in predicting and verifying new relation facts. These promising results also make possible significant improvements in related methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Graph embedding has been proven to be efficient and effective in facilitating graph analysis. In this paper, we present a novel spectral framework called NOn-Backtracking Embedding (NOBE), which offers a new perspective that organizes graph data at a deep level by tracking the flow traversing on the edges with backtracking prohibited. Further, by analyzing the non-backtracking process, a technique called graph approximation is devised, which provides a channel to transform the spectral decomposition on an edge-to-edge matrix to that on a node-to-node matrix. Theoretical guarantees are provided by bounding the difference between the corresponding eigenvalues of the original graph and its graph approximation. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-world networks demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on both macroscopic and microscopic levels, including clustering and structural hole spanner detection.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Important data mining problems such as nearest-neighbor search and clustering admit theoretical guarantees when restricted to objects embedded in a metric space. Graphs are ubiquitous, and clustering and classification over graphs arise in diverse areas, including, e.g., image processing and social networks. Unfortunately, popular distance scores used in these applications, that scale over large graphs, are not metrics and thus come with no guarantees. Classic graph distances such as, e.g., the chemical and the CKS distance are arguably natural and intuitive, and are indeed also metrics, but they are intractable: as such, their computation does not scale to large graphs. We define a broad family of graph distances, that includes both the chemical and the CKS distance, and prove that these are all metrics. Crucially, we show that our family includes metrics that are tractable. Moreover, we extend these distances by incorporating auxiliary node attributes, which is important in practice, while maintaining both the metric property and tractability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As graph datasets grow, faster data mining methods become indispensable. Random Walk with Restart (RWR), belief propagation, semi-supervised learning, and more graph methods can be expressed as a set of linear equations. In this work, we focus on solving such equations fast and accurately when large number of queries need to be handled. We use RWR as a case study, since it is widely used not only to evaluate the importance of a node, but also as a basis for more complex tasks, e.g., representation learning and community detection. We introduce a new, intuitive two-step divide-and-conquer formulation and a corresponding parallelizable method, FlowR, for solving RWR with two goals: (i) fast and accurate computation under multiple queries; (ii) one-time message exchange between subproblems. We further speed up our proposed method by extending our formulation to carefully designed overlapping subproblems (FlowR-OV) and by leveraging the strengths of iterative methods (FlowR-Hyb). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real networks with up to ∼8 million edges show that our methods are accurate and outperform in runtime various state-of-the-art approaches, running up to 34× faster in preprocessing and up to 32× faster in query time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Vibrant residential communities are defined as places with permeability, vitality, variety, accessibility, identity and legibility. Developing vibrant communities can help boost commercial activities, enhance public security, foster social interaction, and thus yield livable, sustainable, and viable environments. However, it is challenging to understand the underlying drivers of vibrant communities to make them traceable and predictable. Toward this goal, we study the problem of ranking vibrant communities using human mobility data and point-of-interests (POIs) data. We analyze large-scale urban and mobile data related to residential communities and find that in order to effectively identify vibrant communities, we should not just consider community “contents” such as buildings, facilities, and transportation, but also take into account the spatial structure. The spatial structure of a community refers to how the geographical items (POIs, road networks, public transits, etc.) of a community are spatially arranged and interact with one another. Along this line, we first develop a geographical learning method to find proper representations of communities. In addition, we propose a novel geographic ensemble ranking strategy, which aggregates a variety of weak rankers to effectively spot vibrant communities. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real-world residential community data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is one of the most frequently-used matrix factorization models in data analysis. A significant reason to the popularity of NMF is its interpretability and the ‘parts of whole’ interpretation of its components. Recently max-times, or subtropical, matrix factorization (SMF) has been introduced as an alternative model with equally useful ‘winner takes it all’ interpretation. In this paper we propose a new mixed linear-tropical model and a new algorithm called Latitude that combines NMF and SMF, being able to smoothly alternate between the two. In our model the data is modeled using latent factors and additional latent parameters that control whether the factors are interpreted as NMF or SMF features or as mixtures of both. We present an algorithm for our novel matrix factorization. Our experiments show that it improves over both baselines and can yield interpretable results that reveal more of the latent structure than either NMF or SMF alone.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Current topic models often suffer from discovering topics not matching human intuition, unnatural switching of topics within documents and high computational demands. We address these shortcomings by proposing a topic model and an inference algorithm based on automatically identifying characteristic keywords for topics. Keywords influence the topic assignments of nearby words. Our algorithm learns (key)word-topic scores and self-regulates the number of topics. The inference is simple and easily parallelizable. A qualitative analysis yields comparable results to those of state-of-the-art models, but with different strengths and weaknesses. Quantitative analysis using eight datasets shows gains regarding classification accuracy, PMI score, computational performance, and consistency of topic assignments within documents, while most often using fewer topics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Finding influential users in online social networks is an important problem with many possible useful applications. HITS and other link analysis methods, in particular, have been often used to identify hub and authority users in web graphs and online social networks. These works, however, have not considered topical aspect of links in their analysis. A straightforward approach to overcome this limitation is to first apply topic models to learn the user topics before applying the HITS algorithm. In this paper, we instead propose a novel topic model known as Hub and Authority Topic (HAT) model to combines the two process so as to jointly learn the hub, authority and topical interests. We evaluate HAT against several existing state-of-the-art methods in two aspects: (i) modeling of topics, and (ii) link recommendation. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets from Twitter and Instagram. Our experiment results show that HAT is comparable to state-of-the-art topic models in learning topics and it outperforms the state-of-the-art in link recommendation task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tensor decompositions are invaluable tools in analyzing multimodal datasets. In many real-world scenarios, such datasets are far from being static, to the contrary they tend to grow over time. For instance, in an online social network setting, as we observe new interactions over time, our dataset gets updated in its “time” mode. How can we maintain a valid and accurate tensor decomposition of such a dynamically evolving multimodal dataset, without having to re-compute the entire decomposition after every single update? In this paper we introduce SamBaTen, a Sampling-based Batch Incremental Tensor Decomposition algorithm, which incrementally maintains the decomposition given new updates to the tensor dataset. SamBaTen is able to scale to datasets that the state-of-the-art in incremental tensor decomposition is unable to operate on, due to its ability to effectively summarize the existing tensor and the incoming updates, and perform all computations in the reduced summary space. We extensively evaluate SamBaTen using synthetic and real datasets. Indicatively, SamBaTen achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art incremental and non-incremental techniques, while being up to 25–30 times faster. Furthermore, SamBaTen scales to very large sparse and dense dynamically evolving tensors of dimensions up to 100K × 100K × 100K where state-of-the-art incremental approaches were not able to operate.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tensor factorization methods have gained increased popularity in the data mining community. A key feature that renders tensors attractive is the essential uniqueness (identifiability) of their decomposition into latent factors: this is crucial for explanatory data analysis – model uniqueness makes interpretations well grounded. In this work, we propose ParaSketch, a distributed tensor factorization algorithm that enables massive parallelism, to deal with large tensors. The idea is to compress/sketch the large tensor into multiple small tensors, decompose each small tensor, and combine the results to reconstruct the desired latent factors. Prior art in this direction entails potentially very high complexity in the (Gaussian) compression and final combining stages. Utilizing sketching matrices for compression, the proposed method greatly reduces compression complexity, and features much simpler combining. Moreover, theoretical analysis shows that the compressed tensors inherit latent identifiability under mild conditions, hence establishing correctness of the overall approach. Our approach to establish identifiability for the sketched tensor is original, and of interest in its own right.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) is a popular and powerful technique for inferring knowledge from data. The mining result is the Boolean product of two matrices, approximating the input dataset. The Boolean product is a disjunction of rank-1 binary matrices, each describing a feature-relation, called pattern, for a group of samples. Yet, there are no guarantees that any of the returned patterns do not actually arise from noise, i.e., are false discoveries. In this paper, we propose and discuss the usage of the false discovery rate in the unsupervised BMF setting. We prove two bounds on the probability that a found pattern is constituted of random Bernoulli-distributed noise. Each bound exploits a specific property of the factorization which minimizes the approximation error—yielding new insights on the minimizers of Boolean matrix factorization. This leads to improved BMF algorithms by replacing heuristic rank selection techniques with a theoretically well-based approach. Our empirical demonstration shows that both bounds deliver excellent results in various practical settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose two methods for exact Gaussian process (GP) inference and learning on massive image, video, spatial-temporal, or multi-output datasets with missing values (or “gaps”) in the observed responses. The first method ignores the gaps using sparse selection matrices and a highly effective low-rank preconditioner is introduced to accelerate computations. The second method introduces a novel approach to GP training whereby response values are inferred on the gaps before explicitly training the model. We find this second approach to be greatly advantageous for the class of problems considered. Both of these novel approaches make extensive use of Kronecker matrix algebra to design massively scalable algorithms which have low memory requirements. We demonstrate exact GP inference for a spatial-temporal climate modelling problem with 3.7 million training points as well as a video reconstruction problem with 1 billion points.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address the nonlinear metric learning by constructing a smooth nonlinear metric from the data. First, we locally define an initial linear metric on each cluster by principal component analysis. Second, we glue such local linear metrics to form a smooth nonlinear metric by a partition of unity on the sample space, and further learn the global nonlinear metric. Third, we conduct the intrinsic steepest descent algorithm on matrix manifolds for implementation. Finally, we compare our approach with several state-of-the-art methods on a variety of datasets. The results validate that the robustness and accuracy of classification are both improved under our nonlinear metric. The novelty of our global smooth nonlinear metric learning model lies in that it has completely overcome drawbacks of local metric learning methods: the partition coefficients obtained by the partition of unity is smooth, while the metric at any point on the manifold can be directly defined.</p>

This work proposes a new model for listwise Learning to Rank (LeTOR) in an inductive semi–supervised setting. We pose the task as that of ranking in a multiview setting, encountered quite commonly in practice. We formulate a novel and efficient co-regularization mechanism that efficiently enforces agreement between views on the rank order of unlabeled samples. This formulation is based on leveraging the convex structures of isotonic vectors and to the best of our knowledge, the first of such co-regularization based frameworks for semi-supervised ranking. We demonstrate the utility of the method when labels are scarce even in settings where supervision is available only as pairwise preferences as well as in comparison to transductive semi–supervised baselines.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In networking applications, one often wishes to obtain estimates about the number of objects at different parts of the network (e.g., the number of cars at an intersection of a road network or the number of packets expected to reach a node in a computer network) by monitoring the traffic in a small number of network nodes or edges. We formalize this task by defining the Markov Chain Monitoring problem. Given an initial distribution of items over the nodes of a Markov chain, we wish to estimate the distribution of items at subsequent times. We do this by asking a limited number of queries that retrieve, for example, how many items transitioned to a specific node or over a specific edge at a particular time. We consider different types of queries, each defining a different variant of the Markov Chain Monitoring. For each variant, we design efficient algorithms for choosing the queries that make our estimates as accurate as possible. In our experiments with synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the efficiency and the efficacy of our algorithms in a variety of settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Weak-label learning is an important branch of multi-label learning; it deals with samples annotated with incomplete (weak) labels. Previous work on weak-label learning mainly considers data represented by a single view. An intuitive way to leverage multiple features obtained from different views is to concatenate the features into a single vector. However, this process is not only prone to over-fitting and often results in very high time-complexity, but also ignores the potentially useful complementary information spread across the different views. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Matrix Completion for multi-view Weak-label Learning (McWL). Matrix completion (MC) has sound theoretical properties and is robust to missing values in both feature and label spaces. Our method enforces the optimization of multiple view integration and of MC-based classification within a unified objective function. Specifically, a kernel target alignment technique and the loss function of an MC-based classifier are used to jointly and iteratively adjust the weights assigned to individual views, and to optimize the classifier. McWL can selectively integrate views and is able to assign small weights to views of low quality. Extensive experiments on a broad range of datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach against competitive algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Machine learning researchers are facing a data deluge quantities of training data have been increasing at a rapid rate. However, most of machine learning algorithms were proposed in the context of learning from relatively smaller quantities of data. We argue that a big data classifier should have superior feature engineering capability, minimal tuning parameters and should be able to learn decision boundaries in fewer passes through the data. In this paper, we have proposed an (computationally) efficient yet (classification-wise) effective family of learning algorithms that fulfils these properties. The proposed family of learning algorithms is based on recently proposed accelerated higher-order logistic regression algorithm: ALRn. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we have added the functionality of out-of-core learning in ALRn, resulting in a limited pass learning algorithm. Second, superior feature engineering capabilities are built and third, a far more efficient (memory-wise) implementation has been proposed. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our proposed algorithm by comparing its performance not only with state-of-the-art classifier in out-of-core learning such as Selective KDB but also with state-of-the-art in in-core learning such as Random Forest.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The nearest neighbor rule is a classic yet essential classification model, particularly in problems where the supervising information is given by pairwise dissimilarities and the embedding function are not easily obtained. Prototype selection provides means of generalization and improving efficiency of the nearest neighbor model, but many existing methods assume and rely on the analyses of the input vector space. In this paper, we explore a dissimilarity-based, parametrized model of the nearest neighbor rule. In the proposed model, the selection of the nearest prototypes is influenced by the parameters of the respective prototypes. It provides a formulation for minimizing the violation of the extended nearest neighbor rule over the training set in a tractable form to exploit numerical techniques. We show that the minimization problem reduces to a large-margin principle learning and demonstrate its advantage by empirical comparisons with other prototype selection methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The past decade has seen a growth in the development and deployment of educational technologies for assisting college-going students in choosing majors, selecting courses and acquiring feedback based on past academic performance. Grade prediction methods seek to estimate a grade that a student may achieve in a course that she may take in the future (e.g., next term). Accurate and timely prediction of students' academic grades is important for developing effective degree planners and early warning systems, and ultimately improving educational outcomes. Existing grade prediction methods mostly focus on modeling the knowledge components associated with each course and student, and often overlook other factors such as the difficulty of each knowledge component, course instructors, student interest, capabilities and effort. In this paper, we propose additive latent effect models that incorporate these factors to predict the student next-term grades. Specifically, the proposed models take into account four factors: (i) student's academic level, (ii) course instructors, (iii) student global latent factor, and (iv) latent knowledge factors. We compared the new models with several state-of-the-art methods on students of various characteristics (e.g., whether a student transferred in or not). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines on grade prediction problem. Moreover, we perform a thorough analysis on the importance of different factors and how these factors can practically assist students in course selection, and finally improve their academic performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many applications the classification model needs to utilize limited resources properly while predicting an instance, e.g. the limited response time for a real-time search engine. In order to satisfy the resource constraint, many researchers try to simplify the model structure or shrink the feature subset size. Because the informative features may take too much cost for the model, a common way is to build a model by considering the trade-off between performance and cost. However, most previous works assume that the cost of a feature is independent of the cost of another feature, which is not practical in reality. In the paper, we consider two categories of the feature cost, individual cost and group cost. The former is independent of the cost of any other feature whereas the latter regards the cost dependency between the other features in the corresponding group. We propose a two-stage framework that integrates the cost-sensitive feature selection and learning a model with a cost budget constraint. First, we propose the group-cost-sensitive random forest (GOAT) model to consider these two costs to select a proper feature subset. Second, we propose a salient ensemble of trees each of which uses cascaded linear classifiers (ETIC) with the satisfaction of the featurecost constraints using the derived features from the GOAT model. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets, including mobile-user preference data and object detection data. When the group cost dominates, GOAT-ETIC can gain a 10–30% improvement over the baselines. Even if the group cost is ignored, GOAT-ETIC can still get better performance than the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, innovative techniques for text processing like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and embedding algorithms like Paragraph Vectors (PV) allowed for improved text classification and retrieval methods. Even though these methods can be adjusted to handle different text collections, they do not take advantage of the fixed document structure that is mandatory in many application areas. In this paper, we focus on patent data which mandates a fixed structure. We propose a new classification method which represents documents as Fixed Hierarchy Vectors (FHV), reflecting the document's structure. FHVs represent a document on multiple levels where each level represents the complete document but with a different local context. Furthermore, we sequentialize this representation and classify documents using LSTM-based architectures. Our experiments show that FHVs provide a richer document representation and that sequential classification improves classification performance when classifying patents into the International Patent Classification (IPC) taxonomy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
For distributed linear classification, L1 regularization is useful because of a smaller model size. However, with the non-differentiability, it is more difficult to develop efficient optimization algorithms. In the past decade, OWLQN has emerged as the major method for distributed training of L1 problems. In this work, we point out issues in OWLQN's search directions. Then we extend the recently developed limited-memory common-directions method for L2-regularized problems to L1 scenarios. Through a unified interpretation of batch methods for L1 problems, we explain why OWLQN has been a popular method and why our method is superior in distributed environments. Experiments confirm that the proposed method is faster than OWLQN in most situations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Transfer Learning (TL) plays a crucial role when a given dataset has insufficient labeled examples to train an accurate model. In such scenarios, the knowledge accumulated within a model pre-trained on a source dataset can be transferred to a target dataset, resulting in the improvement of the target model. Though TL is found to be successful in the realm of image-based applications, its impact and practical use in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications is still a subject of research. Due to their hierarchical architecture, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) provide flexibility and customization in adjusting their parameters and depth of layers, thereby forming an apt area for exploiting the use of TL. In this paper, we report the results and conclusions obtained from extensive empirical experiments using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and try to uncover thumb rules to ensure a successful positive transfer. In addition, we also highlight the flawed means that could lead to a negative transfer. We explore the transferability of various layers and describe the effect of varying hyper-parameters on the transfer performance. Also, we present a comparison of accuracy value and model size against state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we derive inferences from the empirical results and provide best practices to achieve a successful positive transfer.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Anomaly detection and forecasting are two fundamental problems in time series analysis that are relevant to a wide range of academic and industrial disciplines. Although these problems have been investigated in the literature previously, the assumptions therein are too restrictive for autonomous analysis. Common examples of limiting assumptions include perfect knowledge about the time series seasonality and/or presence of anomaly (spikes and level changes) free time windows. Current practice is to manually input this knowledge into anomaly detection and forecasting systems which negate any possibility of autonomous analysis. This paper relaxes these assumptions by jointly estimating the latent components (viz. seasonality, level changes, and spikes) in the observed time series without assuming the availability of anomaly-free time windows. The novel and flexible two stage approach proposed herein is based on (a) sparse modeling of the different latent components of the time series and (b) ARMA modeling for fitting the error. The approach leads to a solution for anomaly detection with control over type-I errors. Further, by design, the method is robust against anomalies in the observation window when it is used to solve the forecasting problem by extrapolation. Experiments are conducted with both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. We compare our approach to various popular baselines. The presented approach outperforms baseline algorithms for anomaly detection in all our experiments and performs favorably for the forecasting task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
How can we efficiently forecast the power consumption of a location for the next few days? More challengingly, how can we forecast the power consumption if the temperature increases by 10° C, the number of appliances in the grid increase by 20%, and voltage levels increase by 5%? Such ‘what-if scenarios' are crucial for future planning, to ensure that the grid remains reliable even under extreme conditions. Our contributions are as follows: 1) Domain knowledge infusion: we propose a novel Temporal BIG model that extends the physics-based BIG model, allowing it to capture changes over time, trends, and seasonality, and temperature effects. 2) Forecasting: our StreamCast algorithm forecasts multiple steps ahead and outperforms baselines in accuracy. Our algorithm is online, requiring constant update time per new data point and bounded memory. 3) What-if scenarios and anomaly detection: our approach can handle scenarios in which the voltage levels, temperature, or number of appliances change. It also spots anomalies in real data, and provides confidence intervals for its forecasts, to assist in planning for various scenarios. Experimental results show that StreamCast has 27% lower forecasting error than baselines on real data, scales linearly, and runs in 4 minutes on a time sequence of 40 million points.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Dynamic time warping constitutes a major tool for analyzing time series. In particular, computing a mean series of a given sample of series in dynamic time warping spaces (by minimizing the Fréchet function) is a challenging computational problem, so far solved by several heuristic, inexact strategies. We spot several inaccuracies in the literature on exact mean computation in dynamic time warping spaces. Our contributions comprise an exact dynamic program computing a mean (useful for benchmarking and evaluating known heuristics). Empirical evaluations reveal significant deficits of the state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of their output quality. Finally, we give an exact polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of binary time series.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Leadership plays a key role in social animals, including humans, decision-making and coalescence in coordinated activities such as hunting, migration, sport, diplomatic negotiation etc. In these coordinated activities, leadership is a process that organizes interactions among members to make a group achieve collective goals. Understanding initiation of coordinated activities allows scientists to gain more insight into social species behaviors. However, by using only time series of activities data, inferring leadership as manifested by the initiation of coordinated activities faces many challenging issues. First, coordinated activities are dynamic and are changing over time. Second, several different coordinated activities might occur simultaneously among subgroups. Third, there is no fundamental concept to describe these activities computationally. In this paper, we formalize Faction Initiator Inference Problem and propose a leadership inference framework as a solution of this problem. The framework makes no assumption about the characteristics of a leader or the parameters of the coordination process. The framework performs better than our non-trivial baseline in both simulated and biological datasets (schools of fish). Moreover, we demonstrate the application of our framework as a tool to study group merging and splitting dynamics on another biological dataset of trajectories of wild baboons. In addition, our problem formalization and framework enable opportunities for scientists to analyze coordinated activities and generate scientific hypotheses about collective behaviors that can be tested statistically and in the field.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Brain Electroencephalography (EEG) classification is widely applied to analyze cerebral diseases in recent years. Unfortunately, invalid/noisy EEGs degrade the diagnosis performance and most previously developed methods ignore the necessity of EEG selection for classification. To this end, this paper proposes a novel maximum weight clique-based EEG selection approach, named mwcEEGs, to map EEG selection to searching maximum similarity-weighted cliques from an improved Fréchet distance-weighted undirected EEG graph simultaneously considering edge weights and vertex weights. Our mwcEEGs improves the classification performance by selecting intra-clique pairwise similar and inter-clique discriminative EEGs with similarity threshold δ. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness compared with the state-of-the-art time series selection algorithms on real-world EEG datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many systems, including space satellites, cannot be upgraded or repaired easily during their missions. Simulation-based design techniques are often used to check conditions that can induce critical malfunctions in them, to ensure sufficient credibility and reliability during operation. However, critical conditions with a very low probability of occurring (e.g., 10−8 per trial) rarely appear within a tractable number of simulations. We propose herein a multicanonical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique extended for the efficient search of rare but critical conditions, to significantly enhance simulation efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of our proposed technique to an efficient search of “stray light” in a space telescope satellite.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The problem of revenue maximization, which aims at earning the highest revenue by properly pricing the product and/or seeding customers, is an important issue about utilizing the social influences. In this paper, we are interested in the marketing of the multi-grade product, where the different grades of a product from a company, such as iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X, have both competitive and promotional relationships. For the study, a new diffusion model named MuG-IC (Multi-Grade IC) is first proposed based on the IC and the concave graph models to describe the phenomena of social influences regarding the multi-grade product. Afterwards, we then study the revenue maximization upon the MuG-IC and solve the problem by designing a novel algorithm named PS (Pricing-Seeding). The PS algorithm can give proper suggestions of pricing each grade of the product and seeding customers by tuning the suggestions in an iterative manner. The experiments conducted on the real network structure with simulated valuation distributions from Amazon.com demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given a set of GPS trajectories, avoidance region discovery (ARD) finds regions that are avoided by drivers. ARD is important for applications such as sociology, city/transportation planning and crime mitigation, where it can help domain users understand the driver behavior under different concerns (e.g. rush hour, congestion, dangerous neighborhood, etc.). ARD is challenging because of the large number of trajectories with thousands of GPS points, large number of candidate avoidance regions, and the cost of evaluating those. Related work is focused on finding evasive trajectories for a given set of avoidance regions. Distinct from the related work, we propose an Avoidance Region Miner (ARM) approach that can detect both the avoidance regions and evasive trajectories just by using the trajectories in hand without the need of an additional input. A case study on real trajectory data confirms that ARM discovers such regions for further investigation by domain users. Experiments show that ARM yields substantial computational savings compared to a baseline approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Visual question answering (VQA) is a recently proposed artificial intelligence task that requires a deep understanding of both images and texts. In deep learning, images are typically modeled through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while texts are typically modeled through recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this work, we perform a detailed analysis on the natural language questions in VQA, which raises a different need for text representations as compared to other natural language processing tasks. Based on the analysis, we propose to rely on CNNs for learning text representations. By exploring various properties of CNNs specialized for text data, we present our “CNN Inception + Gate” model for text feature extraction in VQA. The experimental results show that simply replacing RNNs with our CNN-based model improves question representations and thus the overall accuracy of VQA models. In addition, our model has much fewer parameters and the computation is much faster. We also prove that the text representation requirement in VQA is more complicated and comprehensive than that in conventional natural language processing tasks. Shallow models like the fastText model, which can obtain comparable results with deep learning models in simple tasks like text classification, have poor performances in VQA.</p>

In this paper, we develop a generic black-box expectation propagation (BBEP) algorithm that can be directly applied to Bayesian models without model-specific derivations. BBEP is built on the spirit of using Monte Carlo estimates, where the moment matching step in EP is replaced with Monte Carlo approximations. To avoid high variance, we employ importance sampling for variance reduction and analyze how to find an optimal proposal distribution. We compare BBEP against the state-of-the-art black-box algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets. The experimental results indicate that BBEP can reach better predictive performance than baseline algorithms, and even can be on a par with analytical solutions in some settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Learning to interact with users and discover their preferences is central in most web applications, with recommender systems being a notable example. From such a perspective, merging interactive learning algorithms with recommendation models is natural. While recent literature has explored the idea of combining collaborative filtering approaches with bandit techniques, there exist two limitations: (1) they usually consider Gaussian rewards, which are not suitable for implicit feedback data powering most recommender systems, and (2) they are restricted to the one-item recommendation setting while typically a list of recommendations is given. In this paper, to address these limitations, apart from Gaussian rewards we also consider Bernoulli rewards, the latter being suitable for dyadic data. Also, we consider two user click models: the one-item click/no-click model, and the cascade click model which is suitable for top-K recommendations. For these settings, we propose novel machine learning algorithms that learn to interact with users by learning the underlying parameters collaboratively across users and items. We provide an extensive empirical study, which is the first to illustrate all pairwise empirical comparisons across different interactive learning algorithms for recommendation. Our experiments demonstrate that when the number of users and items is large, propagating the feedback across users and items while learning latent features is the most effective approach for systems to learn to interact with the users.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper aims at improvement on the effectiveness of matrix decomposition (MD) methods for implicit feedback. We highlight two critical limitations of existing works. First, due to the large number of unlabeled feedback, most existing works employ a uniform weight to the missing data to reduce computational complexity. However, such a uniform assumption may rarely hold in real-world scenarios. Second, the commonly-used bilateral loss function might be infinite if the data point is mis-classified. Outliers may have such issues and misguide the learning process. We address the above two issues by learning a robust asymmetric learning model. By leveraging the cost-sensitive learning and capped unilateral loss function, our robust MD objective function integrates them into a joint formulation, where the low-rank basis for user/item profiles can be modeled in an effective and robust way. Particularly, a novel log-determinant function is employed to refine the nuclear norm with respect to the low-rank approximation. We derive an iterative re-weighted algorithm to efficiently minimize this MD objective, and also rigorously prove a lower error bound of the proposed algorithm compared to the 1-bit matrix completion method. Finally, we show the promising experimental results of our algorithm on benchmark recommendation datasets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose a personalized dialogue generation system, which combines reinforcement learning techniques with an attention-based hierarchical recurrent encoderdecoder model. Firstly, we incorporate user-specific information into the decoder to capture user's background information and speaking style. Secondly, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to maximize future reward in dialogue, which enables our system to generate topic-coherent, informative and grammatical responses. Moreover, we propose three types of rewards to characterize good conversations. Finally, we compare the performance of the following reinforcement learning methods in dialogue generation: policy gradient, Q-learning, and actor-critic algorithms. We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two dialogue datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate better personalized dialogues for different users. Quantitatively, our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art dialogue systems in terms of BLEU score, perplexity, and human evaluation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Prediction is widely employed to improve the number of video clicks and views, which are the key important indicators (KPIs) due to their contribution to revenue. The available predictive features, however, are generally limited as compared to the expected prediction capability from the algorithm side. Inspired by the intrinsic dependence among multiple clicks for the same video, we hypothesize that there exist some consistent effects involved in grouped click records. We then propose to recover such effects from the associated hidden features, which are likely to alleviate the insufficiency of features. The simulation studies are performed to elucidate how the derived grouped effects empower a model with additional discriminating capacity compared with the original one. The proposed methodology is further examined on the repository of PPTV (a leading video service provider in China) click records comprehensively. The results confirm the existence of the hypothesized effects and demonstrate their critical role in the performance improvement of video click prediction.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Personalized ranking with implicit feedback (e.g. purchases, views, check-ins) is an important paradigm in recommender systems. Such feedback sometimes comes with textual information (e.g. reviews, comments, tips), which could be a useful signal to reveal item properties, identify users' tastes and interpret their behavior. Although incorporating such information is common in explicit feedback settings (such as rating prediction), it is less common when dealing with implicit feedback, as it is often not available for negative instances (e.g. there is no review associated with the item the user didn't buy). Thus our goal in this study is to propose a ranking method (PRAST) to incorporate such personalized, asymmetric textual signals in implicit feedback settings. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard recommendation baselines, alleviates ‘cold start’ issues, and is able to provide potential textual interpretations for latent feedback dimensions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The increasing complexity of IT environments urgently requires the use of analytical approaches and automated problem resolution for more efficient delivery of IT services. In this paper, we model the automation recommendation procedure of IT automation services as a contextual bandit problem with dependent arms, where the arms are in the form of hierarchies. Intuitively, different automations in IT automation services, designed to automatically solve the corresponding ticket problems, can be organized into a hierarchy by domain experts according to the types of ticket problems. We introduce a novel hierarchical multi-armed bandit algorithms leveraging the hierarchies, which can match the coarse-to-fine feature space of arms. Empirical experiments on a real large-scale ticket dataset have demonstrated substantial improvements over the conventional bandit algorithms. In addition, a case study of dealing with the cold-start problem is conducted to clearly show the merits of our proposed algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given a subset of active nodes in a network can we reconstruct the cascade that has generated these observations? This is a problem that has been studied in the literature, but here we focus in the case that temporal information is available about the active nodes. In particular, we assume that in addition to the subset of active nodes we also know their activation time. We formulate this cascade-reconstruction problem as a variant of a Steiner-tree problem: we ask to find a tree that spans all reported active nodes while satisfying temporal-consistency constraints. We present three approximation algorithms. The best algorithm in terms of quality achieves a -approximation guarantee, where k is the number of active nodes, while the most efficient algorithm has linearithmic running time, making it scalable to very large graphs. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world networks with both simulated and real cascades. Our results indicate that utilizing the available temporal information allows for more accurate cascade reconstruction. Furthermore, our objective leads to finding the “backbone” of the cascade and it gives solutions of high precision.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multiple and co-evolving networks are common in many real settings such as social networks, communication networks and other information networks. Most of the work in the field of network evolution has focused on a single evolving network or specific network pairs, lacking generality in the analysis of multiple networks and ignoring the co-evolutionary dynamics between networks. In practice, a significant amount of information is encoded in the evolution of multiple networks with respect to one another. In this paper, we show how to use a shared temporal matrix factorization framework to model co-evolution across multiple networks, and we refer to this framework as CoEvol. Specifically, the proposed framework decomposes the adjacency matrix of each co-evolving network into a product of network-independent shared factor and a set of network-specific temporal factors, and impose a non-negativity constraint on the factors for greater interpretability. Our approach has the potential to predict multiple changes in co-evolving networks over time, because of its ability to explicitly represent co-evolving networks as a function of time. The CoEvol framework also has the advantage of generality in addressing various temporal tasks across multiple networks. We show the benefits of this approach in predicting co-evolution across multiple networks on the tasks including cross-network link prediction, lag correlation detection and community detection. Compared to baseline methods, CoEvol obtains lower root mean-squared error in cross-network link prediction and higher cluster purity in community detection, which demonstrates that the CoEvol framework can capture the dynamics across multiple networks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Network embedding has gained more attentions in recent years. It has been shown that the learned low-dimensional node vector representations could advance a myriad of graph mining tasks such as node classification, community detection, and link prediction. A vast majority of the existing efforts are overwhelmingly devoted to single-layered networks or homogeneous networks with a single type of nodes and node interactions. However, in many real-world applications, a variety of networks could be abstracted and presented in a multilayered fashion. Typical multi-layered networks include critical infrastructure systems, collaboration platforms, social recommender systems, to name a few. Despite the widespread use of multi-layered networks, it remains a daunting task to learn vector representations of different types of nodes due to the bewildering combination of both within-layer connections and cross-layer network dependencies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of multi-layered network embedding. In particular, we propose a principled framework – MANE to model both within-layer connections and cross-layer network dependencies simultaneously in a unified optimization framework for embedding representation learning. Experiments on real-world multi-layered networks corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
With the development of social networking services, social influence analyses, as well as the influence maximization tasks, have attracted wide attention in both academia and industry. Traditional studies mainly focus on simulating process of influence spread. However, two basic functions of social spread, i.e., information propagation and information adoption have not been clearly distinguished. Usually, as information adoption could be even more significant for information publishers in application scenarios, more comprehensive analysis for effect of adoption is urgently required. To that end, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to generally describe social spread, in which information adoption process is separately formulated as random events. Along this line, when we apply this framework to the information adoption maximization task, with proving that the adoption maximization problem is NP-hard and submodular, we further design a polling-based algorithm to achieve an effective approximation. Extensive experiments on four real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed algorithms, which validates that our approach could better summarize the complete social spread process, and further support the necessity of distinguishing information adoption from information propagation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Community detection in real-world graphs has been shown to benefit from using multi-aspect information, e.g., in the form of “means of communication” between nodes in the network. An orthogonal line of work, broadly construed as semi-supervised learning, approaches the problem by introducing a small percentage of node assignments to communities and propagates that knowledge throughout the graph. In this paper we introduce SMACD, a novel semi-supervised multi-aspect community detection method along with an automated parameter tuning algorithm which essentially renders SMACD parameter-free. To the best of our knowledge, SMACD is the first approach to incorporate multi-aspect graph information and semi-supervision, while being able to discover overlapping and non-overlapping communities. We extensively evaluate SMACD's performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches across eight real and two synthetic datasets, and demonstrate that SMACD, through combining semi-supervision and multi-aspect edge information, outperforms the baselines.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Relational learning has been proposed to cope with the interdependency among linked instances in a network, and it is a fundamental tool to categorize social network users for various tasks. However, the emerging widespread of misinformation in social networks, information that is inaccurate or false, poses novel challenges to utilizing social media data. Malicious users may actively manipulate their content and characteristics, which easily lead to a noisy dataset. Hence, it is intricate for traditional relational learning approaches to deliver an accurate predictive model in the presence of misinformation. In this work, we precisely focus on the problem by proposing a joint framework that simultaneously constructs a relational learning model and mitigates the effect of misinformation by restraining anomalous points. Empirical results on real-world social media data prove the superiority of the proposed approach, Relational Learning with Misinformation (RLM), over traditional approaches on modeling social network users.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Matrix factorization (MF) has earned great success on recommender systems. However, the commonly-used regression-based MF is not only sensitive to outliers but also unable to guarantee that the predicted values are in line with the user preference orders, which is the basis of common measures in recommender systems, e.g., nDCG. To overcome this drawback, we propose personalized ranking on Poisson factorization (PRPF), which utilizes the posteriori based on pair-wise learning to rank instead of the classical regression-based ones. Since the posteriori that combines learning to rank and Poisson factorization does not follow the conjugate prior relationship, we estimate variational parameters approximately and propose two optimization approaches based on variational interference. Due to the combination, PRPF not only preserves user preference but also performs well on a sparse matrix. In the experiment, we show that PRPF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves promising results for recommendation tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
High-order parametric models that include terms for feature interactions are applied to various data mining tasks, where ground truth depends on interactions of features. However, with sparse data, the high-dimensional parameters for feature interactions often face three issues: expensive computation, difficulty in parameter estimation and lack of structure. Previous work has proposed approaches which can partially resolve the three issues. In particular, models with factorized parameters (e.g. Factorization Machines) and sparse learning algorithms (e.g. FTRL-Proximal) can tackle the first two issues but fail to address the third. Regarding to unstructured parameters, constraints or complicated regularization terms are applied such that hierarchical structures can be imposed. However, these methods make the optimization problem more challenging. In this work, we propose Strongly Hierarchical Factorization Machines and ANOVA kernel regression where all the three issues can be addressed without making the optimization problem more difficult. Experimental results show the proposed models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in two data mining tasks: cold-start user response time prediction and stock volatility prediction.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Feature selection methods have been widely adopted to prepare high-dimensional feature spaces for the classification task of data mining. However, in many real-world datasets, the feature space is formed by binary features related via generalization-specialization relationships, also known as hierarchical feature spaces. Although there are many methods for the traditional feature selection problem, methods which properly consider hierarchical features are still very underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) for hierarchical feature selection. The proposed GA has two novel hierarchical mutation operators tailored to deal with redundant features in hierarchical feature spaces. The computational experiments show that our proposed approach exhibited better predictive performance than two state-of-the-art hierarchical feature selection methods (SHSEL and HIP) and also than two traditional feature selection methods (ReliefF and CFS).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Density estimation is one of the most frequently used data analytics techniques. A major challenge of real-world datasets is missing values, originating e.g. from sampling errors or data loss. The recovery of these is often impossible or too expensive. Missing values are not necessarily limited to a few features or samples, rendering methods based on complete auxiliary variables unsuitable. In this paper we introduce three models able to deal with such datasets. They are based on the new concept of virtual objects. Additionally, we present a computationally efficient approximation. Generalizing KDE, our methods are called Warp-KDE. Experiments with incomplete datasets show that Warp-KDE methods are superior to established imputation methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Pattern mining in numerical data remains a challenging task due to the pattern search space that becomes potentially infinite with real-valued dimensions. Most approaches reluctantly reduced the expressiveness of mined patterns to make possible extraction. Despite this expressiveness loss, they do not provide results within a short response time of a few seconds. This paper addresses the instant discovery of patterns in numerical data based on sampling techniques. Instead of splitting each dimension into intervals, we use a metric to introduce the density as new interestingness measure, and to define neighborhood patterns. The language of neighborhood patterns is semantically rich but in return, its size is infinite. We then present a new exact and non-enumerative random procedure to sample this infinite language according to density. An experimental study demonstrates the good compromise between precision and diversity of neighborhood patterns. Finally, in the context of associative classification, we show that a sample of neighborhood patterns is as accurate as traditional methods that traverses the entire search space.</p>
