<p>【Abstract】:
The fundamental challenge facing security professionals is preventing losses, be they operational, financial or mission losses. As a result, one could argue that security professionals share this challenge with safety professionals. Despite their shared challenge, there is little evidence that recent advances that enable one community to better prevent losses have been shared with the other for possible implementation. Limitations in current safety approaches have led researchers and practitioners to develop new models and techniques. These techniques could potentially benefit the field of security. This paper describes a new systems thinking approach to safety that may be suitable for meeting the challenge of securing complex systems against cyber disruptions. Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis for Security (STPA-Sec) augments traditional security approaches by introducing a top-down analysis process designed to help a multidisciplinary team consisting of security, operations, and domain experts identify and constrain the system from entering vulnerable states that lead to losses. This new framework shifts the focus of the security analysis away from threats as the proximate cause of losses and focuses instead on the broader system structure that allowed the system to enter a vulnerable system state that the threat exploits to produce the disruption leading to the loss.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Android uses a permission-based security model to restrict applications from accessing private data and privileged resources. However, the permissions are assigned at the application level, so even untrusted third-party libraries, such as advertisement, once incorporated, can share the same privileges as the entire application, leading to over-privileged problems. We present AFrame, a developer friendly method to isolate untrusted third-party code from the host applications. The isolation achieved by AFrame covers not only the process/permission isolation, but also the display and input isolation. Our AFrame framework is implemented through a minimal change to the existing Android code base; our evaluation results demonstrate that it is effective in isolating the privileges of untrusted third-party code from applications with reasonable performance overhead.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The growing popularity of location-based services (LBS) has led to the emergence of an economy where users announce their location to their peers, indirectly advertising certain businesses. Venues attract customers through offers and discounts for users of such services. Unfortunately, this economy can become a target of attackers with the intent of disrupting the system for fun and, possibly, profit. This threat has raised the attention of LBS, which have invested efforts in preventing fake check-ins. In this paper, we create a platform for testing the feasibility of fake-location attacks, and present our case study of two popular services, namely Foursquare and Facebook Places. We discover their detection mechanisms and demonstrate that both services are still vulnerable. We implement an adaptive attack algorithm that takes our findings into account and uses information from the LBS at run-time, to maximize its impact. This strategy can effectively sustain mayorship in all Foursquare venues and, thus, deter legitimate users from participating. Furthermore, our experimental results validate that detection-based mechanisms are not effective against fake check-ins, and new directions should be taken for designing countermeasures. Hence, we implement a system that employs near field communication (NFC) hardware and a check-in protocol that is based on delegation and asymmetric cryptography, to eliminate fake-location attacks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The growth of Smartphones has bridged the telephony/SMS and the IP worlds, and this has resulted in new opportunities for financially motivated attackers. For example, some malicious campaigns in the cellular network aimed at extracting money fraudulently can do so even without any malware. Detecting and mitigating the variety of attacks in cellular network is difficult because they do not necessarily have a fixed 'signature', and new types of campaigns appear frequently. Further complicating matters, detecting a single malicious entity (a domain name, a phone number, or a short code) that is part of a malicious campaign, is usually not very effective, because the attacker simply moves to using another entity in its place. An effective strategy requires detecting all/most elements involved in the campaign at once. In this paper, we describe a system, based on ideas from anomaly detection and clustering, that aims to detect many different families of widespread malicious campaigns in cellular networks. The system reveals an entire campaign as a graph cluster which includes the various entities involved in the campaign and their relationship, such as malware download websites, C&amp;C servers, spammers, etc. Using logs from both SMS and IP portions of the network for millions of users, we detect newly popular entities and cluster them to discover how they are related. By looking for cues of possible malicious behavior from any of the entities in a cluster, we attempt to ascertain whether a detected campaign might be malicious, providing valuable leads to a human analyst. Our system is live and generates daily clusters for human analysts. We provide detailed case studies of real, previously unseen families of malicious campaigns that this system has successfully brought to light.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Exploiting recent advances in monitoring technology and the drop of its costs, authoritarian and oppressive regimes are tightening the grip around the virtual lives of their citizens. Meanwhile, the dissidents, oppressed by these regimes, are organizing online, cloaking their activity with anti-censorship systems that typically consist of a network of anonymizing proxies. The censors have become well aware of this, and they are systematically finding and blocking all the entry points to these networks. So far, they have been quite successful. We believe that, to achieve resilience to blocking, anti-censorship systems must abandon the idea of having a limited number of entry points. Instead, they should establish first contact in an online location arbitrarily chosen by each of their users. To explore this idea, we have developed Message In A Bottle, a protocol where any blog post becomes a potential "drop point" for hidden messages. We have developed and released a proof-of-concept application of our system, and demonstrated its feasibility. To block this system, censors are left with a needle-in-a-haystack problem: Unable to identify what bears hidden messages, they must block everything, effectively disconnecting their own network from a large part of the Internet. This, hopefully, is a cost too high to bear.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Over the past few years, microblogging social networking services have become a popular means for information sharing and communication. Besides sharing information among friends, such services are currently being used by artists, politicians, news channels, and information providers to easily communicate with their constituency. Even though following specific channels on a microblogging service enables users to receive interesting information in a timely manner, it may raise significant privacy concerns as well. For example, the microblogging service is able to observe all the channels that a particular user follows. This way, it can infer all the subjects a user might be interested in and generate a detailed profile of this user. This knowledge can be used for a variety of purposes that are usually beyond the control of the users. To address these privacy concerns, we propose k-subscription: an obfuscation-based approach that enables users to follow privacy-sensitive channels, while, at the same time, making it difficult for the microblogging service to find out their actual interests. Our method relies on obfuscation: in addition to each privacy-sensitive channel, users are encouraged to randomly follow k -- 1 other channels they are not interested in. In this way (i) their actual interests are hidden in random selections, and (ii) each user contributes in hiding the real interests of other users. Our analysis indicates that k-subscription makes it difficult for attackers to pinpoint a user's interests with significant confidence. We show that this confidence can be made predictably small by slightly adjusting k while adding a reasonably low overhead on the user's system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Privacy concern is still one of the major issues that prevent users from moving to public clouds. The root cause of the privacy problem is that the cloud provider has more privileges than it is necessary, which leaves no options for the cloud users to protect their privacy. Due to the same problem, once the control virtual machine or the cloud platform is compromised, all user's privacy will be breached. Many cryptographic solutions have been developed to protect sensitive data in the cloud. However, arbitrary processing is usually prohibited once cryptography is used. Homomorphic cryptography is considered promising but it does not offer practical performance at the current stage. Instead of cryptographic solutions, in this paper, we propose a new cloud architecture - MyCloud to solve the problem. MyCloud removes the control virtual machine (control VM) from the processor's root mode and only keeps security and performance crucial components in the TCB. MyCloud achieves the following security goals. First, MyCloud de-privileges the cloud provider such that the cloud provider cannot inspect users' memory through the control virtual machine. Second, MyCloud enables user configured privacy protection. Third, the reduced the TCB size also minimizes the attack surface of the cloud platform. We implemented a prototype system with ~5.8K LOCs on x86 architecture. According to our experimental results, our platform shows acceptable overhead while providing significantly enhanced security and privacy protection that can be configured by users.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Traditionally, analysis of malicious software is only a semi-automated process, often requiring a skilled human analyst. As new malware appears at an increasingly alarming rate --- now over 100 thousand new variants each day --- there is a need for automated techniques for identifying suspicious behavior in programs. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting statistically significant malicious behaviors from a system call dependency graph (obtained by running a binary executable in a sandbox). Our approach is based on a new method for measuring the statistical significance of subgraphs. Given a training set of graphs from two classes (e.g., goodware and malware system call dependency graphs), our method can assign p-values to subgraphs of new graph instances even if those subgraphs have not appeared before in the training data (thus possibly capturing new behaviors or disguised versions of existing behaviors).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Automatic malware clustering plays a vital role in combating the rapidly growing number of malware variants. Most existing malware clustering algorithms operate on either static instruction features or dynamic behavior features to partition malware into families. However, these two distinct approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses in handling different types of malware. Moreover, different clustering algorithms and even multiple runs of the same algorithms may produce inconsistent or even contradictory results. To remedy this heterogeneity and lack of robustness of a single clustering algorithm, we propose a novel system called DUET by exploiting the complementary nature of static and dynamic clustering algorithms and optimally integrating their results. By using the concept of clustering ensemble, DUET combines partitions from individual clustering algorithms into a single consensus partition with better quality and robustness. DUET improves existing ensemble algorithms by incorporating cluster-quality measures to effectively reconcile differences and/or contradictions between base malware clusterings. Using real-world malware samples, we compare the performance of DUET (in terms of clustering precision, recall and coverage) with individual state-of-the-art static and dynamic clustering component. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate DUET's capability of improving the coverage of malware samples by 20--40% while keeping the precision near the optimum achievable by any individual clustering algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this work, we propose SigMal, a fast and precise malware detection framework based on signal processing techniques. SigMal is designed to operate with systems that process large amounts of binary samples. It has been observed that many samples received by such systems are variants of previously-seen malware, and they retain some similarity at the binary level. Previous systems used this notion of malware similarity to detect new variants of previously-seen malware. SigMal improves the state-of-the-art by leveraging techniques borrowed from signal processing to extract noise-resistant similarity signatures from the samples. SigMal uses an efficient nearest-neighbor search technique, which is scalable to millions of samples. We evaluate SigMal on 1.2 million recent samples, both packed and unpacked, observed over a duration of three months. In addition, we also used a constant dataset of known benign executables. Our results show that SigMal can classify 50% of the recent incoming samples with above 99% precision. We also show that SigMal could have detected, on average, 70 malware samples per day before any antivirus vendor detected them.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This work describes a new type of efficiency attack that can be used to degrade the performance of automated vehicular transportation systems. Next-generation transportation technologies will leverage increasing use of vehicle automation. Proposed vehicular automation systems include cooperative adaptive cruise control and vehicle platooning strategies which require cooperation and coordination among vehicles. These strategies are intended to optimize through-put and energy usage in future highway systems, but, as we demonstrate, they also introduce new vulnerabilities. In this work we show that a typical platooning system would allow a maliciously controlled vehicle to exert subtle influence on the motion of surrounding vehicles. This effect can be used to increase the energy expenditure of surrounding vehicles by 20% to 300%.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Networked control systems used in energy, manufacturing, and transportation combine large, vulnerable attack surfaces with far overprovisioned privileges. Often, compromising a single computer or user account is sufficient to give an attacker free reign over physical machinery. Significant reduction of attack surface size is an ongoing problem, so we shift our focus to reducing the privileges granted to system operators and embedded controllers. To this end, we introduce C2, an enforcement mechanism for policies governing the usage of electromechanical devices. In presenting C2, we address two basic problems: (i.) How should a policy for physical device usage be expressed and enforced? This is a challenging question, as the safe usage of physical devices is dependent on mechanical limitations and the behavior of nearby devices. (ii.) What actions should be taken if a physical machine is issued an operation that violates the policy? C2 takes measures to ensure unsafe behaviors are not caused when denying slightly erroneous yet legitimate operations. We evaluate C2 against six representative control systems, and show that it can efficiently perform policy checks with less than 3.7% overhead, while not introducing new unsafe behaviors into a control system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Users generally choose weak passwords which can be easily guessed. On the other hand, adoption of alternatives to text passwords has been slow due to cost and usability factors. We acknowledge that incumbent passwords remain difficult to beat and introduce in this study Type&amp;Click (T&amp;C), a hybrid scheme supporting text passwords with the graphical passwords. In T&amp;C, users first type a text as usual and then make a single click on an image to complete the password entry. While largely preserving the login experience with the text passwords, the new scheme utilizes accumulated scientific knowledge in graphical password research (implicit feedback, persuasion during password creation, leveraging cued recall memory). The results of our user study suggest that T&amp;C is promising for augmenting text passwords for improved security without degrading usability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Passwords are the most common form of authentication for computer systems, and with good reason: they are simple, intuitive and require no extra device for their use. Unfortunately, users often choose weak passwords that are easy to guess. Various methods of helping users select strong passwords have been deployed, often in the form of requirements for the minimum length and number of character classes to use. Alternatively, a site could modify a user's password in order to make it more secure; strengthening algorithms have been proposed that extend/modify a user-supplied password until achieving sufficient strength. Researchers have suggested that it may be possible to balance password strength with memorability by limiting automated changes to one or two characters while evaluating the generated passwords' strength against known cracking algorithms. This paper shows that passwords that were strengthened against the best known cracking algorithms are still susceptible to attack, provided the adversary knows the strengthening algorithm. We propose two attacks: (1) by strengthening the data sets with the known algorithm, which increases the percentage of recovered passwords by a factor of 2-5, and (2) by a brute-force attack on the initial passwords and space of possible changes, recovering all passwords produced when a sufficiently weak initial password was suggested. As a result, we find that the proposed strengthening algorithms do not yet satisfy Kerckhoffs's principle.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Systems of programs control more and more of our critical infrastructures. Forty years of system development and research have taught us many lessons in how to build software that is reliable, relatively free of vulnerabilities, and can enforce security policies. Those years of experience seem not to have taught us how to get these lessons put into practice, particularly with respect to security, except in a few specialized places. This essay suggests an approach to capturing what we know in a way that can make a difference in systems on which we all rely.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Cold boot attacks exploit the fact that data in RAM gradually fades away over time, rather than being lost immediately when power is cycled off. An attacker can gain access to all memory contents by a restart or short power-down of the system, a so called cold boot. Consequently, sensitive data in RAM like cryptographic keys are exposed to attackers with physical access. Research in recent years found software-based solutions to the cold boot problem in terms of CPU-bound or memory-less encryption. To date, however, the focus has been set on symmetric ciphers, particularly concerning disk encryption systems. Contrary to that, the work in hand aims to close the gap to asymmetric ciphers. With PRIME, we present a cold boot resistant infrastructure for private RSA operations. All private RSA parameters reside symmetrically encrypted in RAM and are decrypted only within CPU registers. The modular exponentiation algorithm for RSA is implemented entirely on the CPU, such that no sensitive state of RSA ever goes to RAM.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The increasing penetration of Online Social Networks (OSNs) prompts the need for effectively accessing and utilizing social networking information. In numerous applications, users need to make trust and/or access control decisions involving other (possibly stranger) users, and one important factor is often the existence of common social relationships. This motivates the need for secure and privacy-preserving techniques allowing users to assess whether or not they have mutual friends. This paper introduces the Common Friends service, a framework for finding common friends which protects privacy of non-mutual friends and guarantees authenticity of friendships. First, we present a generic construction that reduces to secure computation of set intersection, while ensuring authenticity of announced friends via bearer capabilities. Then, we propose an efficient instantiation, based on Bloom filters, that only incurs a constant number of public-key operations and appreciably low communication overhead. Our software is designed so that developers can easily integrate Common Friends into their applications, e.g., to enforce access control based on users' social proximity in a privacy-preserving manner. Finally, we showcase our techniques in the context of an existing application for sharing (tethered) Internet access, whereby users decide to share access depending on the existence of common friends. A comprehensive experimental evaluation attests to the practicality of proposed techniques.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent work demonstrates the feasibility and practical use of secure two-party computation [5, 9, 15, 23]. In this work, we present the first Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-optimized implementation of an optimized Yao's garbled-circuit protocol for two-party secure computation in the honest-but-curious and 1-bit-leaked malicious models. We implement nearly all of the modern protocol advancements, such as Free-XOR, Pipelining, and OT extension. Our implementation is the first allowing entire circuits to be generated concurrently, and makes use of a modification of the XOR technique so that circuit generation is optimized for implementation on SIMD architectures of GPUs. In our best cases we generate about 75 million gates per second and we exceed the state of the art performance metrics on modern CPU systems by a factor of about 200, and GPU systems by about a factor of 2.3. While many recent works on garbled circuits exploit the embarrassingly parallel nature of many tasks that are part of a secure computation protocol, we show that there are still various forms and levels of parallelization that may yet improve the performance of these protocols. In particular, we highlight that implementations on the SIMD architecture of modern GPUs require significantly different approaches than the general purpose MIMD architecture of multi-core CPUs, which again differ from the needs of parallelizing on compute clusters. Additionally, modifications to the security models for many common protocols have large effects on reasonable parallel architectures for implementation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Much of the Internet's end-to-end security relies on the SSL/TLS protocol along with its underlying X.509 certificate infrastructure. However, the system remains quite brittle due to its liberal delegation of signing authority: a single compromised certification authority undermines trust globally. Several recent high-profile incidents have demonstrated this shortcoming convincingly. Over time, the security community has proposed a number of counter measures to increase the security of the certificate ecosystem; many of these efforts monitor for what they consider tell-tale signs of man-in-the-middle attacks. In this work we set out to understand to which degree benign changes to the certificate ecosystem share structural properties with attacks, based on a large-scale data set of more than 17 billion SSL sessions. We find that common intuition falls short in assessing the maliciousness of an unknown certificate, since their typical artifacts routinely occur in benign contexts as well. We also discuss what impact our observations have on proposals aiming to improve the security of the SSL ecosystem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a new technique, which we call socket overloading, that we apply for off-path attacks on DNS. Socket overloading consists of short, low-rate, bursts of inbound packets, sent by off-path attacker to a victim host. Socket overloading exploits the priority assigned by the kernel to hardware interrupts, and enables an off-path attacker to illicit a side-channel on client hosts, which can be applied to circumvent source port and name server randomisation. Both port and name server randomisation are popular and standardised defenses, recommended in [RFC5452], against attacks by off-path adversaries. We show how to apply socket overloading for DNS cache poisoning and name server pinning against popular systems that support algorithms recommended in [RFC6056] and [RFC4097] respectively. Our socket overloading technique may be of independent interest, and can be applied against other protocols for different attacks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As more and more Internet-based attacks arise, organizations are responding by deploying an assortment of security products that generate situational intelligence in the form of logs. These logs often contain high volumes of interesting and useful information about activities in the network, and are among the first data sources that information security specialists consult when they suspect that an attack has taken place. However, security products often come from a patchwork of vendors, and are inconsistently installed and administered. They generate logs whose formats differ widely and that are often incomplete, mutually contradictory, and very large in volume. Hence, although this collected information is useful, it is often dirty. We present a novel system, Beehive, that attacks the problem of automatically mining and extracting knowledge from the dirty log data produced by a wide variety of security products in a large enterprise. We improve on signature-based approaches to detecting security incidents and instead identify suspicious host behaviors that Beehive reports as potential security incidents. These incidents can then be further analyzed by incident response teams to determine whether a policy violation or attack has occurred. We have evaluated Beehive on the log data collected in a large enterprise, EMC, over a period of two weeks. We compare the incidents identified by Beehive against enterprise Security Operations Center reports, antivirus software alerts, and feedback from enterprise security specialists. We show that Beehive is able to identify malicious events and policy violations which would otherwise go undetected.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Software clone detection techniques identify fragments of code that share some level of syntactic similarity. In this study, we investigate security-sensitive clone clusters: clusters of syntactically similar fragments of code that are protected by some privileges. From a security perspective, security-sensitive clone clusters can help reason about the implemented security model: given syntactically similar fragments of code, it is expected that they are protected by similar privileges. We hypothesize that clones that violate this assumption, defined as security-discordant clones, are likely to reveal weaknesses and flaws in access control models. In order to characterize security-discordant clones, we investigated two of the largest and most popular open-source PHP applications: Joomla! and Moodle, with sizes ranging from hundred thousands to more than a million lines of code. Investigation of security-discordant clone clusters in these systems revealed several previously undocumented, recurring, and application-independent security weaknesses. Moreover, security-discordant clones also revealed four, previously unreported, security flaws. Results also show how these flaws were revealed through the investigation of as little as 2% of the code base. Distribution of weaknesses and flaws between the two systems is investigated and discussed. Potential extensions to this exploratory work are also presented.</p>

In this paper, we develop an approach for protecting system integrity from untrusted code that may harbor sophisticated malware. We develop a novel dual-sandboxing architecture to confine not only untrusted, but also benign processes. Our sandboxes place only a few restrictions, thereby permitting most applications to function normally. Our implementation is performed entirely at the user-level, requiring no changes to the kernel. This enabled us to port the system easily from Linux to BSD. Our experimental results show that our approach preserves the usability of applications, while offering strong protection and good performance. Moreover, policy development is almost entirely automated, sparing users and administrators this cumbersome and difficult task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent advances in bridging the semantic gap between virtual machines (VMs) and their guest processes have a dark side: They can be abused to subvert and compromise VM file system images and process images. To demonstrate this alarming capability, a context-aware, reactive VM Introspection (VMI) instrument is presented and leveraged to automatically break the authentication mechanisms of both Linux and Windows operating systems. By bridging the semantic gap, the attack is able to automatically identify critical decision points where authentication succeeds or fails at the binary level. It can then leverage the VMI to transparently corrupt the control-flow or data-flow of the victim OS at that point, resulting in successful authentication without any password-guessing or encryption-cracking. The approach is highly flexible (threatening a broad class of authentication implementations), practical (realizable against real-world OSes and VM images), and useful for both malicious attacks and forensics analysis of virtualized systems and software.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The visual information captured with camera-equipped mobile devices has greatly appreciated in value and importance as a result of their ubiquitous and connected nature. Today, banking customers expect to be able to deposit checks using mobile devices, and broadcasting videos from camera phones uploaded by unknown users is admissible on news networks. We present Movee, a system that addresses the fundamental question of whether the visual stream coming into a mobile app from the camera of the device can be trusted to be un-tampered with, live data, before it can be used for a variety of purposes. Movee is a novel approach to video liveness analysis for mobile devices. It is based on measuring the consistency between the data from the accelerometer sensor and the inferred motion from the captured video. Contrary to existing algorithms, Movee has the unique strength of not depending on the audio track. Our experiments on real user data have shown that Movee achieves 8% Equal Error Rate.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Bring your own device policies allow private phones to be used in corporate environments. Solutions with multiple operating system personalities aim at solving the tension between the user's needs and the corporate's security policies. These solutions succeed at isolating personal and corporate information at the data level. But thorough research of the security requirements on the user interface to handle different environments on one device is missing. In this work we define a threat model and derive the pre-requisites for a practical and secure user interface for mobile devices. We designed an UI framework which provides the mechanisms to handle multiple environments on a mobile device. Our design is applicable to several different virtualization solutions. We implemented a prototype that runs on a real device and evaluated it in terms of usability and security.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Android is currently the largest mobile platform with around 750 million devices worldwide. Unfortunately, more than 30% of all devices contain publicly known security vulnerabilities and, in practice, cannot be updated through normal mechanisms since they are not longer supported by the manufacturer and mobile operator. This failure of traditional patch distribution systems has resulted in the creation of a large population of vulnerable mobile devices. In this paper, we present PatchDroid, a system to distribute and apply third-party security patches for Android. Our system is designed for device-independent patch creation, and uses in-memory patching techniques to address vulnerabilities in both native and managed code. We created a fully usable prototype of PatchDroid, including a number of patches for well-known vulnerabilities in Android devices. We evaluated our system on different devices from multiple manufacturers and show that we can effectively patch security vulnerabilities on Android devices without impacting performance or usability. Therefore, PatchDroid represents a realistic path towards dramatically reducing the number of exploitable Android devices in the wild.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Solid-state drives (SSDs) are inherently different from traditional drives, as they incorporate data-optimization mechanisms to overcome their limitations (such as a limited number of program-erase cycles, or the need of blanking a block before writing). The most common optimizations are wear leveling, trimming, compression, and garbage collection, which operate transparently to the host OS and, in certain cases, even when the disks are disconnected from a computer (but still powered up). In simple words, SSD controllers are designed to hide these internals completely, rendering them inaccessible if not through direct acquisition of the memory cells. These optimizations have a significant impact on the forensic analysis of SSDs. The main cause is that memory cells could be pre-emptively blanked, whereas a traditional drive sector would need to be explicitly rewritten to physically wipe off the data. Unfortunately, the existing literature on this subject is sparse and the conclusions are seemingly contradictory. In this paper we propose a generic, practical, test-driven methodology that guides researchers and forensics analysts through a series of steps that assess the "forensic friendliness" of a SSD. Given a drive of the same brand and model of the one under analysis, our methodology produces a decision that helps an analyst to determine whether or not an expensive direct acquisition of the memory cells is worth the effort, because the extreme optimizations may have rendered the data unreadable or useless. We apply our methodology to three SSDs produced by top vendors (Samsung, Corsair, and Crucial), and provide a detailed description of how each step should be conducted.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Modern workstations and servers implicitly trust hard disks to act as well-behaved block devices. This paper analyzes the catastrophic loss of security that occurs when hard disks are not trustworthy. First, we show that it is possible to compromise the firmware of a commercial off-the-shelf hard drive, by resorting only to public information and reverse engineering. Using such a compromised firmware, we present a stealth rootkit that replaces arbitrary blocks from the disk while they are written, providing a data replacement back-door. The measured performance overhead of the compromised disk drive is less than 1% compared with a normal, non-malicious disk drive. We then demonstrate that a remote attacker can even establish a communication channel with a compromised disk to infiltrate commands and to ex-filtrate data. In our example, this channel is established over the Internet to an unmodified web server that relies on the compromised drive for its storage, passing through the original webserver, database server, database storage engine, filesystem driver, and block device driver. Additional experiments, performed in an emulated disk-drive environment, could automatically extract sensitive data such as /etc/shadow (or a secret key file) in less than a minute. This paper claims that the difficulty of implementing such an attack is not limited to the area of government cyber-warfare; rather, it is well within the reach of moderately funded criminals, botnet herders and academic researchers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The ability to trap the execution of a binary program at desired instructions is essential in many security scenarios such as malware analysis and attack provenance. However, an increasing percent of both malicious and legitimate programs are equipped with anti-debugging and anti-instrumentation techniques, which render existing debuggers and instrumentation tools inadequate. In this paper, we present Spider, a stealthy program instrumentation framework which enables transparent, efficient and flexible instruction-level trapping based on hardware virtualization. Spider uses invisible breakpoint, a novel primitive we develop that inherits the efficiency and flexibility of software breakpoint, and utilizes hardware virtualization to hide its side-effects from the guest. We have implemented a prototype of Spider on KVM. Our evaluation shows that Spider succeeds in remaining transparent against state-of-the-art anti-debugging and anti-instrumentation techniques; the overhead of invisible breakpoint is comparable with traditional hardware breakpoint. We also demonstrate Spider's usage in various security applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Android as an open platform dominates the booming mobile market. However its permission mechanism is inflexible and often results in over-privileged applications. This in turn creates severe security issues. Aiming to support the Principle of Least Privilege, we propose and implement a Dynamic Role Based Access Control for Android (DR BACA) model to enhance Android security, particularly in corporate environment. Our system offers multi-user management on Android mobile devices comparable to traditional workstations, and provides fine-grained Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to enhance Android security at both the application and permission level. Moreover, by leveraging context-aware capabilities of mobile devices and Near Field communication (NFC) technology, our solution supports dynamic RBAC to provide more flexible access control while still being able to mitigate some of the most serious security risks on mobile devices. The DR BACA system can easily be managed, even in large business environments with many mobile devices. We show that our DR BACA system can be deployed and used with ease. With a proper security policy, our evaluation shows that DR BACA can effectively mitigate the security risks posed by both malicious and vulnerable non-malicious applications while incurring only a small overall system overhead.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Runtime attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities are still an important concern nowadays. Even smartphone operating systems such as Apple's iOS are affected by such attacks since the system is implemented in Objective-C, a programming language that enables attacks such as buffer overflows. As a generic protection technique against a whole class of attacks, control-flow integrity (CFI) offers some interesting properties. Recent work demonstrated that CFI can be implemented on iOS by patching the binary during the loading process and adding an instrumentation layer that enforces CFI during runtime. However, this approach is of little practical value since it requires a jailbroken device, which hinders wide employment. Furthermore, binary patching has a certain performance impact. In this paper, we show how CFI can be implemented directly within a compiler, making the approach widely deployable on all kinds of iOS devices. We extend the LLVM compiler and add our CFI enforcement approach during the compilation phase of a given app. An empirical evaluation shows that the size and performance overhead is reasonable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Malware poses a serious threat to Android smartphones. Current security mechanisms offer poor protection and are often too inflexible to quickly mitigate new exploits. In this paper we present FireDroid, a policy-based framework for enforcing security policies by interleaving process system calls. The main advantage of FireDroid is that it is completely transparent to the applications as well as to the Android OS. FireDroid enforces security policies without modifying either the Android OS or its applications. FireDroid is able to perform security checks on third-party and pre-installed applications, as well as malicious native code. We have implemented a novel mechanism that is able to attach, identify, monitor and enforce polices for any process spawned by the Android's mother process Zygote. We have tested the effectiveness of FireDroid against real malware. Moreover, we show how FireDroid can be used as a swift solution for blocking OS and application vulnerabilities before patches are available. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our approach showing that it has only a limited overhead. Given these facts, FireDroid represents a practical solution for strengthening security on Android smartphones.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Web applications can have vulnerabilities that result in server-side data leaks. Securing sensitive data from Web applications while ensuring reasonable performance and without requiring developers to rewrite entire applications is challenging. We present SilverLine, which prevents bulk data leaks caused due to code injection in Web applications as well as compromised user-level processes on the application server. SilverLine uses login information to associate a user with each Web session; it then taints each file and database record and applies information-flow tracking to the data associated with each session to ensure that application data is released only to sessions of authorized users. SilverLine focuses on isolating data between user sessions and is thus most suitable to applications that involve single user sessions (e.g., banking, e-commerce). We have implemented SilverLine on Linux; our implementation demonstrates that SilverLine can protect a PHP-based Web application from many of the most common server-side Web application attacks by modifying only about 60 lines of code from the original application. Our evaluation shows that SilverLine incurs a performance overhead of about 20-30% over unmodified applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper introduces Senser, a system for validating retrieved web content. Senser does not rely on a PKI and operates even when SSL/TLS is not supported by the web server. Senser operates as a network of proxies located at different vantage points on the Internet. Clients query a random subset of Senser proxies for compact descriptions of a desired web page, and apply consensus and matching algorithms to the returned results to locally render a "majority" web page. To ensure diverse selections of proxies (and consequently decrease an adversary's ability to manipulate a majority of the proxies' requests), Senser leverages Internet mapping systems that accurately predict AS-level paths between available proxies and the desired web page. We demonstrate using a deployment of Senser on Amazon EC2 that Senser detects and mitigates attempts by adversaries to manipulate web content --- even when controlling large collections of autonomous systems --- while maintaining reasonable performance overheads.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a novel and simple approach for securing access to sensitive content on the web. The approach automates the best manual compartmentalization practices for accessing different kinds of content with different browser instances. The automation is transparent to the user and does not require any modification of how non-sensitive content is accessed. For sensitive content, a Fresh Browser Instance (FBI) is automatically created to access the content. Our prototype system Auto-FBI can provide support for novice users with predefined sensitive content sites as well as for more experienced users who can define conflict of interest (COI) classes which allows content from sites in the same user-defined class to coexist in a browser instance. Our initial performance evaluation of Auto-FBI shows that the overhead introduced by the approach is acceptable (less than 160 ms for sites that already have fast load time, but for slow sites the overhead can be as high as 750 ms).</p>
