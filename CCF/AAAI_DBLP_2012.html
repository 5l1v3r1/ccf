<p>【Abstract】:
With the exponential increase in the number of documents available online, e.g., news articles, weblogs, scientific documents, the development of effective and efficient classification methods is needed. The performance of document classifiers critically depends, among other things, on the choice of the feature representation. The commonly used "bag of words" and n-gram representations can result in prohibitively high dimensional input spaces. Data mining algorithms applied to these input spaces may be intractable due to the large number of dimensions. Thus, dimensionality reduction algorithms that can process data into features fast at runtime, ideally in  constant time per feature, are greatly needed in high throughput applications, where the number of features and data points can be in the order of millions. One promising line of research to dimensionality reduction is feature clustering. We propose to combine two types of feature clustering, namely hashing and abstraction based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering, in order to take advantage of the strengths of both techniques. Experimental results on two text data sets show that the combined approach uses significantly smaller number of features and gives similar performance when compared with the "bag of words" and n-gram approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
SPARQL query containment under schema axioms is the problem of determining whether, for any RDF graph satisfying a given set of schema axioms, the answers to a query are contained in the answers of another query. This problem has major applications for verification and optimization of queries. In order to solve it, we rely on the mu-calculus. Firstly, we provide a mapping from RDF graphs into transition systems. Secondly, SPARQL queries and RDFS and SHI axioms are encoded into mu-calculus formulas. This allows us to reduce query containment and equivalence to satisfiability in the mu-calculus. Finally, we prove a double exponential upper bound for containment under SHI schema axioms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Foursquare, Facebook, and Brightkite, etc., have attracted millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins. The available check-in information makes it possible to mine users’ preference on locations and to provide favorite recommendations. Personalized Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in LBSNs since it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers to provide personalized services. To solve this task, matrix factorization is a promising tool due to its success in recommender systems. However, previously proposed matrix factorization (MF) methods do not explore geographical influence, e.g., multi-center check-in property, which yields suboptimal solutions for the recommendation. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fuse MF with geographical and social influence for POI recommendation in LBSNs. We first capture the geographical influence via modeling the probability of a user’s check-in on a location as a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM). Next, we include social information and fuse the geographical influence into a generalized matrix factorization framework. Our solution to POI recommendation is efficient and scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally, we conduct thorough experiments on a large-scale real-world LBSNs dataset and demonstrate that the fused matrix factorization framework with MGM utilizes the distance information sufficiently and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Anchor texts are useful complementary description for target pages, widely applied to improve search relevance. The benefits come from the additional information introduced into document representation and the intelligent ways of estimating their relative importance. Previous work on anchor importance estimation treated anchor text independently without considering its context. As a result, the lack of constraints from such context fails to guarantee a stable anchor text representation. We propose an anchor graph regularization approach to incorporate constraints from such context into anchor text weighting process, casting the task into a convex quadratic optimization problem. The constraints draw from the estimation of anchor-anchor, anchor-page, and page-page similarity. Based on any estimators, our approach operates as a post process of refining the estimated anchor weights, making it a plug and play component in search infrastructure. Comparable experiments on standard data sets (TREC 2009 and 2010) demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As the semantic web expands, ontological data becomes distributed over a large network of data sources on the Web. Consequently, evaluating queries that aim to tap into this distributed semantic database necessitates the ability to consult multiple data sources efficiently. In this paper, we propose methods and heuristics to efficiently query distributed ontological data based on a series of properties of summarized data. In our approach, each source summarizes its data as another RDF graph, and relevant section of these summaries are merged and analyzed at query evaluation time. We show how the analysis of these summaries enables more efficient source selection, query pruning and transformation of expensive distributed joins into local joins.</p>

We examine designs for crowdsourcing contests, where participants compete for rewards given to superior solutions of a task. We theoretically analyze tradeoffs between the expectation and variance of the principal's utility (i.e. the best solution's quality), and empirically test our theoretical predictions using a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our evaluation method is also crowdsourcing based and relies on the peer prediction mechanism.  Our theoretical analysis shows an expectation-variance tradeoff of the principal's utility in such contests through a Pareto efficient frontier.  In particular, we show that the simple contest with 2 authors and the 2-pair contest have good theoretical properties. In contrast, our empirical results show that the 2-pair contest is the superior design among all designs tested, achieving the highest expectation and lowest variance of the principal's utility.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We explore the problem of assigning heterogeneous tasks to workers with different, unknown skill sets in crowdsourcing markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. We first formalize the online task assignment problem, in which a requester has a fixed set of tasks and a budget that specifies how many times he would like each task completed. Workers arrive one at a time (with the same worker potentially arriving multiple times), and must be assigned to a task upon arrival. The goal is to allocate workers to tasks in a way that maximizes the total benefit that the requester obtains from the completed work. Inspired by recent research on the online adwords problem, we present a two-phase exploration-exploitation assignment algorithm and prove that it is competitive with respect to the optimal offline algorithm which has access to the unknown skill levels of each worker. We empirically evaluate this algorithm using data collected on Mechanical Turk and show that it performs better than random assignment or greedy algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first work to extend the online primal-dual technique used in the online adwords problem to a scenario with unknown parameters, and the first to offer an empirical validation of an online primal-dual algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Techniques for music recommendation are increasingly relying on hybrid representations to retrieve new and exciting music. A key component of these representations is musical content, with texture being the most widely used feature. Current techniques for representing texture however are inspired by speech, not music, therefore music representations are not capturing the correct nature of musical texture. In this paper we investigate two parts of the well-established mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) representation: the resolution of mel-frequencies related to the resolution of musical notes; and how best to describe the shape of texture. Through contextualizing these parts, and their relationship to music, a novel music-inspired texture representation is developed. We evaluate this new texture representation by applying it to the task of music recommendation. We use the representation to build three recommendation models, based on current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that by understanding two key parts of texture representation, it is possible to achieve a significant recommendation improvement. This contribution of a music-inspired texture representation will not only improve content-based representation, but will allow hybrid systems to take advantage of a stronger content component.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
During broadcast events such as the Superbowl, the U.S. Presidential and Primary debates, etc., Twitter has become the de facto platform for crowds to share perspectives and commentaries about them. Given an event and an associated large-scale collection of tweets, there are two fundamental research problems that have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One is to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified framework. We evaluate the proposed model both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.</p>

Comparing entities is an important part of decision making. Several approaches have been reported for mining comparable entities from Web sources to improve user experience in comparing entities online.However, these efforts extract only entities explicitly compared in the corpora, and may exclude entities that occur less-frequently but potentially comparable. To build a more complete comparison machine that can infer such missing relations, here we develop a solutionto predict transitivity of known comparable relations. Named CliqueGrow, our approach predicts missing links given a comparable entity graph obtained from versus query logs. Our approach achieved the highest F1-score among five link prediction approaches and a commercial comparison engine provided by Yahoo!.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently crowdsourcing services are often used to collect a large amount of labeled data for machine learning, since they provide us an easy way to get labels at very low cost and in a short period. The use of crowdsourcing has introduced a new challenge in machine learning, that is, coping with the variable quality of crowd-generated data. Although there have been many recent attempts to address the quality problem of multiple workers, only a few of the existing methods consider the problem of learning classifiers directly from such noisy data. All these methods modeled the true labels as latent variables, which resulted in non-convex optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a convex optimization formulation for learning from crowds without estimating the true labels by introducing personal models of the individual crowd workers. We also devise an efficient iterative method for solving the convex optimization problems by exploiting conditional independence structures in multiple classifiers. We evaluate the proposed method against three competing methods on synthetic data sets and a real crowdsourced data set and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other three methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, ontology stream reasoning has been introduced as a multidisciplinary approach, merging synergies from Artificial Intelligence, Database and World-Wide-Web to reason on semantics-augmented data streams, thus a way to answering questions on real time events. However existing approaches do not consider stream change diagnosis i.e., identification of the nature and cause of changes, where explaining the logical connection of knowledge and inferring insight on time changing events are the main challenges. We exploit the Description Logics (DL)-based semantics of streams to tackle these challenges. Based on an analysis of stream behavior through change and inconsistency over DL axioms, we tackled change diagnosis by determining and constructing a comprehensive view on potential causes of inconsistencies. We report a large-scale evaluation of our approach in the context of live stream data from Dublin City Council.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
To ensure quality results from unreliable crowdsourced workers, task designers often construct complex workflows and aggregate worker responses from redundant runs. Frequently, they experiment with several alternative workflows to accomplish the task, and eventually deploy the one that achieves the best performance during early trials. Surprisingly, this seemingly natural design paradigm does not achieve the full potential of crowdsourcing. In particular, using a single workflow (even the best) to accomplish a task is suboptimal. We show that alternative workflows can compose synergistically to yield much higher quality output. We formalize the insight with a novel probabilistic graphical model. Based on this model, we design and implement AGENTHUNT, a POMDP-based controller that dynamically switches between these workflows to achieve higher returns on investment. Additionally, we design offline and online methods for learning model parameters. Live experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate the superiority of AGENTHUNT for the task of generating NLP training data, yielding up to 50% error reduction and greater net utility compared to previous methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Entity Recognition (ER) is a key component of relation extraction systems and many other natural-language processing applications. Unfortunately, most ER systems are restricted to produce labels from to a small set of entity classes, e.g., person, organization, location or miscellaneous. In order to intelligently understand text and extract a wide range of information, it is useful to more precisely determine the semantic classes of entities mentioned in unstructured text. This paper defines a fine-grained set of 112 tags, formulates the tagging problem as multi-class, multi-label classification, describes an unsupervised method for collecting training data, and presents the FIGER implementation. Experiments show that the system accurately predicts the tags for entities. Moreover, it provides useful information for a relation extraction system, increasing the F1 score by 93%. We make FIGER and its data available as a resource for future work.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Trust is one of the most important factors for participants' decision-making in Online Social Networks (OSNs). The trust network from a source to a target without any prior interaction contains some important intermediate participants, the trust relations between the participants, and the social context, each of which has an important influence on trust evaluation. Thus, before performing any trust evaluation, the contextual trust network from a given source to a target needs to be extracted first, where constraints on the social context should also be considered to guarantee the quality of extracted networks. However, this problem has been proved to be NP-Complete. Towards solving this challenging problem, we first propose a complex contextual social network structure which considers social contextual impact factors. These factors have significant influences on both social interaction between participants and trust evaluation. Then, we propose a new concept called QoTN (Quality of Trust Network) and a social context-aware trust network discovery model. Finally, we propose a Social Context-Aware trust Network discovery algorithm (SCAN) by adopting the Monte Carlo method and our proposed optimization strategies. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed model and algorithm outperform the existing methods in both algorithm efficiency and the quality of the extracted trust network.</p>

We present a knowledge-rich approach to computing semantic relatedness which exploits the joint contribution of different languages. Our approach is based on the lexicon and semantic knowledge of a wide-coverage multilingual knowledge base, which is used to compute semantic graphs in a variety of languages. Complementary information from these graphs is then combined to produce a 'core' graph where disambiguated translations are connected by means of strong semantic relations. We evaluate our approach on standard monolingual and bilingual datasets, and show that: i) we outperform a graph-based approach which does not use multilinguality in a joint way; ii) we achieve uniformly competitive results for both resource-rich and resource-poor languages.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The recent popularization of social web services has made them one of the primary uses of the World Wide Web. An important concept in social web services is social actions such as making connections and communicating with others and adding annotations to web resources. Predicting social actions would improve many fundamental web applications, such as recommendations and web searches. One remarkable characteristic of social actions is that they involve multiple and heterogeneous objects such as users, documents, keywords, and locations. However, the high-dimensional property of such multinomial relations poses one fundamental challenge, that is, predicting multinomial relations with only a limited amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new multinomial relation prediction method, which is robust to data sparsity. We transform each instance of a multinomial relation into a set of binomial relations between the objects and the multinomial relation of the involved objects. We then apply an extension of a low-dimensional embedding technique to these binomial relations, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem guaranteeing global optimal solutions. We also incorporate attribute information as side information to address the “cold start” problem in multinomial relation prediction. Experiments with various real-world social web service datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust against data sparseness as compared to several existing methods, which can only find sub-optimal solutions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The flourishing of online labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) makes it easy to recruit many workers for solving small tasks. We study whether information elicitation and aggregation over a combinatorial space can be achieved by integrating small pieces of potentially imprecise information, gathered from a large number of workers through simple, one-shot interactions in an online labor market. We consider the setting of predicting the ranking of $n$ competing candidates, each having a hidden underlying strength parameter. At each step, our method estimates the strength parameters from the collected pairwise comparison data and adaptively chooses another pairwise comparison question for the next recruited worker. Through an MTurk experiment, we show that the adaptive method effectively elicits and aggregates information, outperforming a naive method using a random pairwise comparison question at each step.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents REWOrD, an approach to compute semantic relatedness between entities in the Web of Data representing real word concepts. REWOrD exploits the graph nature of RDF data and the SPARQL query language to access this data. Through simple queries, REWOrD constructs weighted vectors keeping the informativeness of RDF predicates used to make statements about the entities being compared. The most informative path is also considered to further refine informativeness. Relatedness is then computed by the cosine of the weighted vectors. Differently from previous approaches based on Wikipedia, REWOrD does not require any prepro- cessing or custom data transformation. Indeed, it can lever- age whatever RDF knowledge base as a source of background knowledge. We evaluated REWOrD in different settings by using a new dataset of real word entities and investigate its flexibility. As compared to related work on classical datasets, REWOrD obtains comparable results while, on one side, it avoids the burden of preprocessing and data transformation and, on the other side, it provides more flexibility and applicability in a broad range of domains.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Researchers have begun to mine social network data in order to predict a variety of social, economic, and health related phenomena. While previous work has focused on predicting aggregate properties, such as the prevalence of seasonal influenza in a given country, we consider the task of fine-grained prediction of the health of specific people from noisy and incomplete data. We construct a probabilistic model that can predict if and when an individual will fall ill with high precision and good recall on the basis of his social ties and co-locations with other people, as revealed by their Twitter posts. Our model is highly scalable and can be used to predict general dynamic properties of individuals in large real-world social networks. These results provide a foundation for research on fundamental questions of public health, including the identification of non-cooperative disease carriers ("Typhoid Marys"), adaptive vaccination policies, and our understanding of the emergence of global epidemics from day-to-day interpersonal interactions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
For the learning-to-ranking algorithms used in commercial search engines, a conventional way to generate the training examples is to employ professional annotators to label the relevance of query-url pairs. Since label quality depends on the expertise of annotators to a large extent, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Automatically generating labels from click-through data has been well studied to have comparable or better performance than human judges. Click-through data present users’ action and imply their satisfaction on search results, but exclude the interactions between users and search results beyond the page-view level (e.g., eye and mouse movements). This paper proposes a novel approach to comprehensively consider the information underlying mouse trajectory and click-through data so as to describe user behaviors more objectively and achieve a better understanding of the user experience. By integrating multi-sources data, the proposed approach reveals that the relevance labels of query-url pairs are related to positions of urls and users’ behavioral features. Based on their correlations, query-url pairs can be labeled more accurately and search results are more satisfactory to users. The experiments that are conducted on the most popular Chinese commercial search engine (Baidu) validated the rationality of our research motivation and proved that the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A wealth of ontologies, many of which overlap in their scope, has made aligning ontologies an important problem for the semantic Web. Consequently, several algorithms now exist for automatically aligning ontologies, with mixed success in their performances. Crucial challenges for these algorithms involve scaling to large ontologies, and as applications of ontology alignment evolve, performing the alignment in a reasonable amount of time without compromising on the quality of the alignment. A class of alignment algorithms is iterative and often consumes more time than others while delivering solutions of high quality. We present a novel and general approach for speeding up the multivariable optimization process utilized by these algorithms. Specifically, we use the technique of block-coordinate descent in order to possibly improve the speed of convergence of the iterative alignment techniques. We integrate this approach into three well-known alignment systems and show that the enhanced systems generate similar or improved alignments in significantly less time on a comprehensive testbed of ontology pairs. This represents an important step toward making alignment techniques computationally more feasible.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Relation extraction, the process of converting natural language text into structured knowledge, is increasingly important. Most successful techniques use supervised machine learning to generate extractors from sentences that have been manually labeled with the relations' arguments. Unfortunately, these methods require numerous training examples, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. This paper presents ontological smoothing, a semi-supervisedtechnique that learns extractors for a set of minimally-labeledrelations. Ontological smoothing has three phases. First, itgenerates a mapping between the target relations and a backgroundknowledge-base. Second, it uses distant supervision toheuristically generate new training examples for the targetrelations. Finally, it learns an extractor from a combination of theoriginal and newly-generated examples. Experiments on 65 relationsacross three target domains show that ontological smoothing candramatically improve precision and recall, even rivaling fully supervisedperformance in many cases.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA), which aims at answering users'subjective questions using summaries of multiple opinions, becomes increasingly important. One challenge of ASQA is that expected answers for subjective questions may not readily exist in the Web. The rising and popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, which provide platforms for people to post and answer questions, provides an alternative to ASQA. One important task of ASQA is question subjectivity identification, which identifies whether a user is asking a subjective question. Unfortunately, there has been little labeled training data available for this task. In this paper, we propose an approach to collect training data automatically by utilizing social signals in CQA sites without involving any manual labeling. Experimental results show that our data-driven approach achieves 9.37% relative improvement over the supervised approach using manually labeled data, and achieves 5.15% relative gain over a state-of-the-art semi-supervised approach. In addition, we propose several heuristic features for question subjectivity identification. By adding these features, we achieve 11.23% relative improvement over word n-gram feature under the same experimental setting.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As the popularity of the social media increases, as evidenced in Twitter, Facebook and China's Renren, spamming activities also picked up in numbers and variety.  On social network sites, spammers often disguise themselves by creating fake accounts and hijacking normal users' accounts for personal gains. Different from the spammers in traditional systems such as SMS and email, spammers in social media behave like normal users  and they continue to change their spamming strategies to fool anti spamming systems. However, due to the privacy and resource concerns, many social media websites cannot fully monitor all the contents of users, making many of the previous approaches, such as topology-based and content-classification-based methods, infeasible to use.  In this paper, we propose a novel method for spammer detection in social networks that exploits both social activities as well as users' social relations in an innovative and highly scalable manner. The proposed method detects spammers following collective activities based on users' social actions and relations.  We have empirically tested our method on data from Renren.com, which is the largest social network in China, and demonstrated that our new method can improve the detection performance significantly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
For Web service composition, choreography has recently received great attention and demonstrated a few key advantages over orchestration such as distributed control, fairness, data efficiency, and scalability. Automated design of choreography plans, especially distributed plans for multiple roles, is more complex and has not been studied before. Existing work requires manual generation assisted by model checking. In this paper, we propose a novel planning-based approach that can automatically convert a given composition task to a distributed choreography specification. Although planning has been used for orchestration, it is difficult to use planning for choreography, as it involves decentralized control, concurrent workflows, and contingency. We propose a few novel techniques, including compilation of contingencies, dependency graph analysis, and communication control, to handle these characteristics using planning. We theoretically show the correctness of this approach and empirically evaluate its practicability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
An important difference between traditional AI systems and human intelligence is our ability to harness common sense knowledge gleaned from a lifetime of learning and experiences to inform our decision making and behavior. This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically for lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. Common sense knowledge also provides the background knowledge for humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. In order for machines to exploit common sense knowledge in reasoning as humans do, moreover, we need to endow them with human-like reasoning strategies. In this work, we propose a two-level affective reasoning framework that concurrently employs multi-dimensionality reduction and graph mining techniques to mimic the integration of conscious and unconscious reasoning, and exploit it for sentiment analysis.</p>

Episodic memory endows agents with numerous general cognitive capabilities, such as action modeling and virtual sensing. However, for long-lived agents, there are numerous unexplored computational challenges in supporting useful episodic-memory functions while maintaining real-time reactivity. In this paper, we review the implementation of episodic memory in Soar and present an expansive evaluation of that system. We demonstrate useful applications of episodic memory across a variety of domains, including games, mobile robotics, planning, and linguistics. In these domains, we characterize properties of environments, tasks, and episodic cues that affect performance, and evaluate the ability of Soar’s episodic memory to support hours to days of real-time operation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In order to collaborate with people in the real world, cognitive systems must be able to represent and reason about spatial regions in human environments. Consider the command "go to the front of the classroom". The spatial region mentioned (the front of the classroom) is not perceivable using geometry alone. Instead it is defined by its functional use, implied by nearby objects and their configuration. In this paper, we define such areas as context-dependent spatial regions and present a cognitive system able to learn them by combining qualitative spatial representations, semantic labels, and analogy. The system is capable of generating a collection of qualitative spatial representations describing the configuration of the entities it perceives in the world. It can then be taught context-dependent spatial regions using anchor pointsdefined on these representations.  From this we then demonstrate how an existing computational model of analogy can be used to detect context-dependent spatial regions in previously unseen rooms. To evaluate this process we compare detected regions to annotations made on maps of real rooms by human volunteers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Creating software agents that learn interactively requires the ability to learn from a small number of trials, extracting general, flexible knowledge that can drive behavior from observation and interaction. We claim that qualitative models provide a useful intermediate level of causal representation for dynamic domains, including the formulation of strategies and tactics. We argue that qualitative models are quickly learnable, and enable model-based reasoning techniques to be used to recognize, operationalize, and construct more strategic knowledge. This paper describes an approach to incrementally learning qualitative influences by demonstration in the context of a strategy game. We show how the learned model can help a system play by enabling it to explain which actions could contribute to maximizing a quantitative goal. We also show how reasoning about the model allows it to reformulate a learning problem to address delayed effects and credit assignment, such that it can improve its performance on more strategic tasks such as city placement.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Generating future states of the world is an essential component of high-level cognitive tasks such as planning. We explore the notion that such future-state generation is more widespread and forms an integral part of cognition. We call these generated states expectations, and propose that cognitive systems constantly generate expectations, match them to observed behavior and react when a difference exists between the two. We describe an ACT-R model that performs expectation-driven cognition on two tasks – pedestrian tracking and behavior classification. The model generates expectations of pedestrian movements to track them. The model also uses differences in expectations to identify distinctive features that differentiate these tracks. During learning, the model learns the association between these features and the various behaviors. During testing, it classifies pedestrian tracks by recalling the behavior associated with the features of each track. We tested the model on both single and multiple behavior datasets and compared the results against a k-NN classifier. The k-NN classifier outperformed the model in correct classifications, but the model had fewer incorrect classifications in the multiple behavior case, and both systems had about equal incorrect classifications in the single behavior case.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One issue facing agents that accumulate large bodies of knowledge is determining whether they have knowl- edge that is relevant to its current goals. Performing comprehensive searches of long-term memory in every situation can be computationally expensive and disrup- tive to task reasoning. In this paper, we demonstrate that the recognition judgment — a heuristic for whether memory structures have been previously perceived — can serve as a low-cost indicator of the existence of potentially relevant knowledge. We present an approach for computing both context-dependent and context- independent recognition judgments using processes and data shared with declarative memories. We then de- scribe an initial, efficient implementation in the Soar cognitive architecture and evaluate our system in a word sense disambiguation task, showing that it reduces the number of memory searches without degrading agent performance.</p>

Metaphors being at the heart of our language and thought process, computationally modelling them is imperative for reproducing human cognitive abilities. In this work, we propose a plausible grounded cognitive model for artificial metaphor acquisition. We put forward a rule-based metaphor acquisition system, which doesn't make use of any prior 'seed metaphor set'. Through correlation between a video and co-occurring commentaries, we show that these rules can be automatically acquired by an early learner capable of manipulating multi-modal sensory input. From these grounded linguistic concepts, we derive classes based on lexico-syntactical language properties. Based on the selectional preferences of these linguistic elements, metaphorical mappings between source and target domains are acquired.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Two information decay methods are examined that help multi-agent systems cope with dynamic environments.  The agents in this simulation have human-like memory and a mechanism to moderate their communications: they forget internally stored information via temporal decay, and they forget distributed information by filtering it as it passes through a communication network.  The agents play a foraging game, in which performance depends on communicating facts and requests and on storing facts in internal memory.  Parameters of the game and agent models are tuned to human data.  Agent groups with moderated communication in small-world networks achieve optimal performance for typical human memory decay values, while non-adaptive agents benefit from stronger memory decay. The decay and filtering strategies interact with the properties of the network graph in ways suggestive of an evolutionary co-optimization between the human cognitive system and an external social structure.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Scott Turner's 1993 Minstrel system was a high water mark in story generation, harnessing the concept of imaginative recall to generate creative stories. Using case-based reasoning and an author level planning system, Minstrel models human creative processes. However, the algorithmic and representational commitments made in Minstrel were never subject to principled and quantitative analysis. By rationally reconstructing Minstrel, we are able to investigate Turner's computational model of creativity and learn new lessons about his architecture. We find that Minstrel's original performance was tied to a well-groomed case library, but by modifying several components of the algorithm we can create a more general version which can construct stories using a sparser and less structured case library. Through a rational reconstruction of Minstrel, we both learn new architectural and algorithmic lessons about Minstrel’s computational model of creativity as well as make his architecture available to the contemporary research community for further experimentation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Scientists use two forms of knowledge in the construction ofexplanatory models: generalized entities and processes that relatethem; and constraints that specify acceptable combinations of thesecomponents. Previous research on inductive process modeling, whichconstructs models from knowledge and time-series data, has relied onhandcrafted constraints. In this paper, we report an approach todiscovering such constraints from a set of models that have beenranked according to their error on observations. Our approach adaptsinductive techniques for supervised learning to identify processcombinations that characterize accurate models. We evaluate themethod's ability to reconstruct known constraints and to generalizewell to other modeling tasks in the same domain. Experiments with synthetic data indicate that the approach can successfully reconstructknown modeling constraints. Another study using natural data suggests that transferring constraints acquired from one modeling scenario to another within the same domain considerably reduces the amount of search for candidate model structures while retaining the most accurate ones.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One of the most challenging problems on modern urban planning and one of the goals to be solved for smart city design is that of urban waste disposal. Given urban population growth, and that the amount of waste generated by each of us citizens is also growing, the total amount of waste to be collected and treated is growing dramatically (EPA 2011), becoming one sensitive issue for local governments. A modern technique for waste collection that is steadily being adopted is automated vacuum waste collection. This technology uses air suction on a closed network of underground pipes to move waste from the collection points to the processing station, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as inconveniences to citizens (odors, noise, . . . ) and allowing better waste reuse and recycling. This technique is open to optimize energy consumption because moving huge amounts of waste by air impulsion requires a lot of electric power. The described problem challenge here is, precisely, that of organizing and scheduling waste collection to minimize the amount of energy per ton of collected waste in such a system via the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques. This kind of problems are an inviting opportunity to showcase the possibilities that AI for Computational Sustainability offers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In conservation biology and natural resource management, adaptive management is an iterative process of improving management by reducing uncertainty via monitoring. Adaptive management is the principal tool for conserving endangered species under global change, yet adaptive management problems suffer from a poor suite of solution methods. The common approach used to solve an adaptive management problem is to assume the system state is known and the system dynamics can be one of a set of pre-defined models. The solution method used is unsatisfactory, employing value iteration on a discretized belief MDP which restricts the study to very small problems. We show how to overcome this limitation by modelling an adaptive management problem as a restricted Mixed Observability MDP called hidden model MDP (hmMDP). We demonstrate how to simplify the value function, the backup operator and the belief update computation. We show that, although a simplified case of POMDPs, hm-MDPs are PSPACE-complete in the finite-horizon case. We illustrate the use of this model to manage a population of the threatened Gouldian finch, a bird species endemic to Northern Australia. Our simple modelling approach is an important step towards efficient algorithms for solving adaptive management problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Local and distributed power generation is increasingly relianton renewable power sources, e.g., solar (photovoltaic or PV) andwind energy. The integration of such sources into the power grid ischallenging, however, due to their variable and intermittent energyoutput. To effectively use them on alarge scale, it is essential to be able to predict power generation at afine-grained level. We describe a novel Bayesian ensemble methodologyinvolving three diverse predictors. Each predictor estimates mixingcoefficients for integrating PV generation output profiles but capturesfundamentally different characteristics. Two of them employ classicalparameterized (naive Bayes) and non-parametric (nearest neighbor) methods tomodel the relationship between weather forecasts and PV output. The thirdpredictor captures the sequentiality implicit in PV generation and uses motifsmined from historical data to estimate the most likely mixture weights usinga stream prediction methodology. We demonstrate the success and superiority of ourmethods on real PV data from two locations that exhibit diverse weatherconditions. Predictions from our model can be harnessed to optimize schedulingof delay tolerant workloads, e.g., in a data center.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Swirls of ocean currents known as ocean eddies are a crucial component of the ocean's dynamics. In addition to dominating the ocean's kinetic energy, eddies play a significant role in the transport of water, salt, heat, and nutrients. Therefore, understanding current and future eddy patterns is a central climate challenge to address future sustainability of marine ecosystems. The emergence of sea surface height observations from satellite radar altimeter has recently enabled researchers to track eddies at a global scale. The majority of studies that identify eddies from observational data employ highly parametrized connected component algorithms using expert filtered data, effectively making reproducibility and scalability challenging. In this paper, we frame the challenge of monitoring ocean eddies as an unsupervised learning problem. We present a novel change detection algorithm that automatically identifies and monitors eddies in sea surface height data based on heuristics derived from basic eddy properties. Our method is accurate, efficient, and scalable. To demonstrate its performance we analyze eddy activity in the Nordic Sea (60-80N and 20W-20E), an area that has received limited attention and has proven to be difficult to analyze using other methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
One of the primary aspects of sustainable development involves accurate understanding and modeling of environmental phenomena. Many of these phenomena exhibit variations in both space and time and it is imperative to develop a deeper understanding of techniques that can model space-time dynamics accurately. In this paper we propose NOSTILL-GP - NOn-stationary Space TIme variable Latent Length scale GP, a generic non-stationary, spatio-temporal Gaussian Process (GP) model. We present several strategies, for efficient training of our model, necessary for real-world applicability. Extensive empirical validation is performed using three real-world environmental monitoring datasets, with diverse dynamics across space and time. Results from the experiments clearly demonstrate general applicability and effectiveness of our approach for applications in environmental monitoring.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Illegal extraction of forest resources is fought, in many developing countries, by patrols that try to make this activity less profitable, using the threat of confiscation. With a limited budget, officials will try to distribute the patrols throughout the forest intelligently, in order to most effectively limit extraction. Prior work in forest economics has formalized this as a Stackelberg game, one very different in character from the discrete Stackelberg problem settings previously studied in the multiagent literature. Specifically, the leader wishes to minimize the distance by which a profit-maximizing extractor will trespass into the forest---or to maximize the radius of the remaining ``pristine'' forest area. The follower's cost-benefit analysis of potential trespass distances is affected by the likelihood of being caught and suffering confiscation. In this paper, we give a near-optimal patrol allocation algorithm and a 1/2-approximation algorithm, the latter of which is more efficient and yields simpler, more practical patrol allocations. Our simulations indicate that these algorithms substantially outperform existing heuristic allocations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Pre-symptomatic drought stress prediction is of great relevance in precision plant protection, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of "How to feed a hungry world?". Unfortunately, it also presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability: it is a temporal, large-scale prediction task, e.g., when monitoring plants over time using hyperspectral imaging, and features are <code>things' with a</code>biological' meaning and interpretation and not just mathematical abstractions computable for any data. In this paper we propose Dirichlet-aggregation regression (DAR) to meet the challenge. DAR represents all data by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time and easy to interpret.Then, it puts a Gaussian process prior on the Dirichlet distributions induced on the simplex spanned by the extremes. The prior can be a function of any observed meta feature such as time, location, type of fertilization, and plant species. We evaluated DAR on two hyperspectral image series of plants over time with about 2 (resp. 5.8) Billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that DAR can be learned efficiently and predicts stress well before it becomes visible to the human eye.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We address the problem of spatial conservation planning in which the goal is to maximize the expected spread of cascades of an endangered species by strategically purchasing land parcels within a given budget. This problem can be solved by standard integer programming methods using the sample average approximation (SAA) scheme. Our main contribution lies in exploiting the separable structure present in this problem and using Lagrangian relaxation techniques to gain scalability over the flat representation. We also generalize the approach to allow the application of the SAA scheme to a range of stochastic optimization problems. Our iterative approach is highly efficient in terms of space requirements and it provides an upper bound over the optimal solution at each iteration. We apply our approach to the Red-cockaded Woodpecker conservation problem. The results show that it can find the optimal solution significantly faster---sometimes by an order-of-magnitude---than using the flat representation for a range of budget sizes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The transition to renewables requires storage to help smooth short-term variations in energy from wind and solar sources, as well as to respond to spikes in electricity spot prices, which can easily exceed 20 times their average. Efficient operation of an energy storage device is a fundamental problem, yet classical algorithms such as $Q$-learning can diverge for millions of iterations, limiting practical applications. We have traced this behavior to the max-operator bias, which is exacerbated by high volatility in the reward function, and high discount factors due to the small time steps. We propose an elegant bias correction procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Understanding ecological complexity has stymied scientists for decades. Recent elucidation of the famously coined "devious strategies for stability in enduring natural systems" has opened up a new field of computational analyses of complex ecological networks where the nonlinear dynamics of many interacting species can be more realistically modeled and understood. Here, we describe the first extension of this field to include coupled human-natural systems. This extension elucidates new strategies for sustaining extraction of biomass (e.g., fish, forests, fiber) from ecosystems that account for ecological complexity and can pursue multiple goals such as maximizing economic profit, employment and carbon sequestration by ecosystems. Our more realistic modeling of ecosystems helps explain why simpler "maximum sustainable yield" bioeconomic models underpinning much natural resource extraction policy leads to less profit, biomass, and biodiversity than predicted by those simple models. Current research directions of this integrated natural and social science include applying artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and multiplayer online games.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A key problem in climate science is how to combine the predictions of the multi-model ensemble of global climate models. Recent work in machine learning (Monteleoni et al. 2011) showed the promise of an algorithm for online learning with experts for this task.We extend the Tracking Climate Models (TCM) approach to (1) take into account climate model predictions at higher spatial resolutions and (2) to model geospatial neighborhood influence between regions. Our algorithm enables neighborhood influence by modifying the transition dynamics of the Hidden Markov Model used by TCM, allowing the performance of spatial neighbors to influence the temporal switching probabilities for the best expert (climate model) at a given location. In experiments on historical data at a variety of spatial resolutions, our algorithm demonstrates improvements over TCM, when tracking global temperature anomalies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Modelling the density of an infectious disease in space and time is a task generally carried out separately from the diagnosis of that disease in individuals. These two inference problems are complementary, however: diagnosis of disease can be done more accurately if prior information from a spatial risk model is employed, and in turn a disease density model can benefit from the incorporation of rich symptomatic information rather than simple counts of presumed cases of infection. We propose a unifying framework for both of these tasks, and illustrate it with the case of malaria. To do this we first introduce a state space model of malaria spread, and secondly a computer vision based system for detecting plasmodium in microscopical blood smear images, which can be run on location-aware mobile devices. We demonstrate the tractability of combining both elements and the improvement in accuracy this brings about.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many signals of interest are corrupted by faults of anunknown type. We propose an approach that uses Gaus-sian processes and a general “fault bucket” to capturea priori uncharacterised faults, along with an approxi-mate method for marginalising the potential faultinessof all observations. This gives rise to an efficient, flexible algorithm for the detection and automatic correction of faults. Our method is deployed in the domain of water monitoring and management, where it is able to solve several fault detection, correction, and prediction problems. The method works well despite the fact that the data is plagued with numerous difficulties, including missing observations, multiple discontinuities, nonlinearity and many unanticipated types of fault.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an approach by which individual appliances can be iteratively separated from an aggregate load. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it assume complete knowledge of the appliances present in the household. Instead, we propose an approach in which prior models of general appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures extracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are then used to estimate each appliance's load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load. This process is applied iteratively until all appliances for which prior behaviour models are known have been disaggregated. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach using the REDD data set, and show the disaggregation performance when using our training approach is comparable to when sub-metered training data is used. We also present a deployment of our system as a live application and demonstrate the potential for personalised energy saving feedback.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Active participation of customers in the management of demand, and renewable energy supply, is a critical goal of the Smart Grid vision. However, this is a complex problem with numerous scenarios that are difficult to test in field projects. Rich and scalable simulations are required to develop effective strategies and policies that elicit desirable behavior from customers. We present a versatile agent-based "factored model" that enables rich simulation scenarios across distinct customer types and varying agent granularity. We formally characterize the decisions to be made by Smart Grid customers as a multiscale decision-making problem and show how our factored model representation handles several temporal and contextual decisions by introducing a novel "utility optimizing agent." We further contribute innovative algorithms for (i) statistical learning-based hierarchical Bayesian timeseries simulation, and (ii) adaptive capacity control using decision-theoretic approximation of multiattribute utility functions over multiple agents. Prominent among the approaches being studied to achieve active customer participation is one based on offering customers financial incentives through variable-price tariffs; we also contribute an effective solution to the problem of "customer herding" under such tariffs. We support our contributions with experimental results from simulations based on real-world data on an open Smart Grid simulation platform.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are fast emerging as a suitable means of integrating small and distributed energy resources (DERs), like wind and solar, into the electricity supply network (Grid). VPPs are formed via the aggregation of a large number of such DERs, so that they exhibit the characteristics of a traditional generator in terms of predictability and robustness. In this work, we promote the formation of such "cooperative'' VPPs (CVPPs) using multi-agent technology. In particular, we design a payment mechanism that encourages DERs to join CVPPs with large overall production. Our method is based on strictly proper scoring rules and incentivises the provision of accurate predictions from the CVPPs---and in turn, the member DERs---which aids in the planning of the supply schedule at the Grid. We empirically evaluate our approach using the real-world setting of 16 commercial wind farms in the UK. We show that our mechanism incentivises real DERs to form CVPPs, and outperforms the current state of the art payment mechanism developed for this problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Widespread accounts of the harmful effects of invasive species have stimulated both practical and theoretical studies on how the spread of these destructive agents can be contained. In practice, a widely used method is the deployment of biological control agents, that is, the release of an additional species (which may also spread) that creates a hostile environment for the invader. Seeding colonies of these protective biological control agents can be used to build a kind of living barrier against the spread of the harmful invader, but the ecological literature documents that attempts to establish colonies of biological control agents often fail (opening gaps in the barrier). Further, the supply of the protective species is limited, and the full supply may not be available immediately. This problem has a natural temporal component: biological control is deployed as the extent of the harmful invasion grows. How can a limited supply of unreliable biological control agents best be deployed over time to protect the landscape against the spread of a harmful invasive species? To explore this question we introduce a new family of stochastic graph vaccination problems that generalizes ideas from social networks and multistage graph vaccination. We point out a deterministic (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm for a deterministic base case studied in the social networks literature (matching the previous best randomized (1 -1/e) guarantee for that problem). Next, we show that the randomized (1 -1/e) guarantee (and a deterministic 1/2 guarantee) can be extended to our much more general family of stochastic graph vaccination problems in which vaccinations (a.k.a. biological control colonies) spread but may be unreliable. For the non-spreading vaccination case with unreliable vaccines, we give matching results in trees. Qualitatively, our extension is from computing “cuts over time” to computing “robust cuts over time.” Our new family of problems captures the key tensions we identify for containing invasive species spread with unreliable biological control agents: a robust barrier is built over time with unreliable resources to contain an expanding invasion.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Deciding what mix of engine and battery power to use is critical to hybrid vehicles' fuel efficiency. Current solutions consider several factors such as the charge of the battery and how efficient the engine operates at a given speed.  Previous research has shown that by taking into account the future power requirements of the vehicle, a more efficient balance of engine vs. battery power can be attained. In this paper, we utilize a probabilistic driving route prediction system, trained using Inverse Reinforcement Learning, to optimize the hybrid control policy. Our approach considers routes that the driver is likely to be taking, computing an optimal mix of engine and battery power. This approach has the potential to increase vehicle power efficiency while not requiring any hardware modification or change in driver behavior.  Our method outperforms a standard hybrid control policy, yielding an average of 1.22% fuel savings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce the problem of scheduling land purchases to conserve an endangered species in a way that achieves maximum population spread but delays purchases as long as possible, so that conservation planners retain maximum flexibility and use available budgets in the most efficient way. We develop the problem formally as a stochastic optimization problem over a network cascade model describing the population spread, and present a solution approach that reduces the stochastic problem to a novel variant of a Steiner tree problem. We give a primal-dual algorithm for the problem that computes both a feasible solution and a bound on the quality of an optimal solution. Our experiments, using actual conservation data and a standard diffusion model, show that the approach produces near optimal results and is much more scalable than more generic off-the-shelf optimizers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present an efficient approach to ambulance fleet allocation and dynamic redeployment, where the goal is to position an entire fleet of ambulances to base locations to maximize the service level (or utility) of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. We take a simulation-based approach, where the utility of an allocation is measured by directly simulating emergency requests. In both the static and dynamic settings, this modeling approach leads to an exponentially large action space (with respect to the number of ambulances). Futhermore, the utility of any particular allocation can only be measured via a seemingly “black box” simulator. Despite this complexity, we show that embedding our simulator within a simple and efficient greedy allocation algorithm produces good solutions. We derive data-driven performance guarantees which yield small optimality gap. Given its efficiency, we can repeatedly employ this approach in real-time for dynamic repositioning. We conduct simulation experiments based on real usage data of an EMS system from a large Asian city, and demonstrate significant improvement in the system’s service levels using static allocations and redeployment policies discovered by our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As (Lee et al., 2012) have shown, weighted constraint satisfaction    problems can benefit from the introduction of global cost    functions, leading to a new Cost Function Programming paradigm.  In this paper, we explore the possibility of decomposing global    cost functions in such a way that enforcing soft local    consistencies on the decomposition offers guarantees on the level    of consistency enforced on the original global cost function. We    show that directional arc consistency and virtual arc consistency    offer such guarantees. We conclude by experiments on decomposable    cost functions showing that decompositions may be very useful to    easily integrate efficient global cost functions in solvers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a novel approach to bidirectional breadth-first IDA<em> (BFIDA</em>) and demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of peg solitaire, a simple puzzle. Our approach improves upon unidirectional BFIDA<em> by usually avoiding the last iteration of search entirely, greatly speeding up search. In addition, we provide a number of improvements specific to peg solitaire. We have improved duplicate-detection in the context of BFIDA</em>. We have strengthened the heuristic used in the previous state-of-the-art solver. Finally, we use bidirectional search frontiers to provide a stronger technique for pruning unsolvable states. The combination of these approaches allows us to improve over the previous state-of-the-art, often by a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in search time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Dots-And-Boxes is a well-known and widely-played combinatorial game. While the rules of play are very simple, the state space for even very small games is extremely large, and finding the outcome under optimal play is correspondingly hard. In this paper we introduce a Dots-And-Boxes solver which is significantly faster than the current state-of-the-art: over an order-of-magnitude faster on several large problems. Our approach uses Alpha-Beta search and applies a number of techniques---both problem-specific and general---that reduce the search space to a manageable size. Using these techniques, we have determined for the first time that Dots-And-Boxes on a board of 4 x 5 boxes is a tie given optimal play; this is the largest game solved to date.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Although successfully employed on many industrial problems, Combinatorial Optimization still has limited applicability on several real-world domains, often due to modeling difficulties. This is typically the case for systems under the control of an on-line policy: even when the policy itself is well known, capturing its effect on the system in a declarative model is often impossible by conventional means. Such a difficulty is at the root of the classical, sharp separation between off- line and on-line approaches. In this paper, we investigate a general method to model controlled systems, based on the integration of Machine Learning and Constraint Programming (CP). Specifically, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to learn the behavior of a controlled system (a multicore CPU with thermal con- trollers) and plug it into a CP model by means of Neuron Constraints. The method obtains significantly better results compared to an approach with no ANN guidance. Neuron Constraints were first introduced in [Bartolini et al., 2011b] as a mean to model complex systems: providing evidence of their applicability to controlled systems is a significant step forward, broadening the application field of combinatorial methods and disclosing opportunities for hybrid off-line/on-line optimization.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
An interesting strategy called configuration checking (CC) was recently proposed to handle the cycling problem in local search for Minimum Vertex Cover. A natural question is whether this CC strategy also works for SAT. The direct application of CC did not result in stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms that can compete with the current best SLS algorithms for SAT. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic based on CC for SLS algorithms for SAT, which is called configuration checking with aspiration (CCA). It is used to develop a new SLS algorithm called Swcca. The experiments on random 3-SAT instances show that Swcca significantly outperforms Sparrow2011, the winner of the random satisfiable category of the SAT Competition 2011, which is considered to be the best local search solver for random 3-SAT instances. Moreover, the experiments on structured instances show that Swcca is competitive with Sattime, the best local search solver for the crafted benchmark in the SAT Competition 2011.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose two new strategies to design efficient local search algorithms for the minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem. There are two main drawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms: First, they select a pair of vertices to be exchanged simultaneously, which is time consuming; Second, although they use edge weighting techniques, they do not have a strategy to decrease the weights. To address these drawbacks, we propose two new strategies: two stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to be exchanged separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. We utilize these two strategies to design a new algorithm dubbed NuMVC. The experimental results show that NuMVC significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms on most of the hard DIMACS instances and all instances in the hard random BHOSLIB benchmark.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Temporal problems with uncertainty are a well established formalism to model time constraints of a system interacting with an uncertain environment. Several works have addressed the definition and the solving of controllability problems, and three degrees of controllability have been proposed: weak, strong, and dynamic. In this work we focus on weak controllability: we address both the decision and the strategy extraction problems. Extracting a strategy means finding a function from assignments to uncontrollable time points to assignments to controllable time points that fulfills all the temporal constraints. We address the two problems in the satisfiability modulo theory framework. We provide a clean and complete formalization of the problems, and we propose novel techniques to extract strategies. We also provide experimental evidence of the scalability and efficiency of the proposed techniques.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper considers the restoration of multiple interdependent infrastructures after a man-made or natural disaster. Modern infrastructures feature complex cyclic interdependencies and require a holistic restoration process.  This paper presents the first scalable approach for the last-mile restoration of the joint electrical power and gas infrastructures. It builds on an earlier three-stage decomposition for restoring the power network that decouples the  restoration ordering and the routing aspects. The key contributions  of the paper are (1) mixed-integer programming models for finding a minimal restoration set and a restoration ordering and (2) a randomized adaptive decomposition to obtain high-quality solutions  within the required time constraints. The approach is validated on a  large selection of benchmarks based on the United States infrastructures and state-of-the-art weather and fragility simulation tools. The results show significant improvements over current field practices.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A<em> is often described as being `optimal', in that it expands the minimum number of unique nodes. But, A</em> may generate many extra nodes which are never expanded. This is a performance loss, especially when the branching factor is large. Partial Expansion A<em> addresses this problem when expanding a node, n, by generating all the children of n but only storing children with the same f-cost as n. n is re-inserted into the OPEN list, but with the f-cost of the next best child. This paper introduces an enhanced version of PEA</em> (EPEA<em>). Given a priori domain knowledge, EPEA</em> generates only the children with the same f-cost as the parent. EPEA<em> is generalized to its iterative-deepening variant, EPE-IDA</em>. For some domains, these algorithms yield substantial performance improvements. State-of-the-art results were obtained for the pancake puzzle and for some multi-agent pathfinding instances. Drawbacks of EPEA* are also discussed.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The increasing availability of “utility computing” resources such as clouds, grids, and massively parallel shared clusters can provide practically unlimited processing and memory capacity on demand, at some cost per unit of resource usage. This requires a new perspective in the design and evaluation of parallel search algorithms. Previous work in parallel search implicitly assumed ownership of a cluster with a static amount of CPU cores and RAM, and emphasized wallclock runtime. With utility computing resources, trade-offs between performance and monetary costs must be considered. This paper considers dynamically increasing the usage of utility computing resources until a problem is solved. Efficient resource allocation policies are analyzed in comparison with an optimal allocation strategy. We evaluate our iterative allocation strategy by applying it to the HDA* parallel search algorithm. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions. They show that, in practice, the costs incurred by iterative allocation are reasonably close to an optimal (but a priori unknown) policy, and are significantly better than the worst-case analytical bounds.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Local Search is one of the fundamental approaches to combinatorial optimization and it is used throughout AI. Several local search algorithms are based on searching the  k -exchange neighborhood. This is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most  k  elements. As a rule of thumb, the larger  k  is, the better are the chances of finding an improved solution. However, for inputs of size  n,  a naive brute-force search of the k-exchange neighborhood requires  n  (O( k ))  time, which is not practical even for very small values of  k.  Fellows et al. (IJCAI 2009) studied whether this brute-force search is avoidable and gave positive and negative answers for several combinatorial problems. They used the notion of local search in a strict sense. That is, an improved solution needs to be found in the k-exchange neighborhood even if a global optimum can be found efficiently. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of local search, called permissive local search (Marx and Schlotter, IWPEC 2009) and investigate whether it enhances the domain of tractable inputs. We exemplify this approach on a fundamental combinatorial problem, Vertex Cover. More precisely, we show that for a class of inputs, finding an optimum is hard, strict local search is hard, but permissive local search is tractable. We carry out this investigation in the framework of parameterized complexity.</p>

We present a dynamic branching scheme for set partitioning problems. The idea is to trace features of the underlying MIP model and to base search decisions on the features of the current subproblem to be solved. We show how such a system can be trained efficiently by introducing minimal learning bias that traditional model-based machine learning approaches rely on. Experiments on a highly heterogeneous collection of set partitioning instances show significant gains over dynamic search guidance in Cplex as well as instance-specifically tuned pure search heuristics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In recent years, significant progress in the area of search, constraint satisfaction, and automated reasoning has been driven in part by the study of challenge problems from combinatorics and finite algebra. This work has led to the discovery of interesting discrete structures with intricate mathematical properties. While some of those results have resolved open questions and conjectures, a shortcoming is that they generally do not provide further mathematical insights, from which one could derive more general observations. We propose an approach that integrates specialized combinatorial search, using so-called streamlining, with a human computation component. We use this approach to discover efficient constructive procedures for generating certain classes of combinatorial objects of any size. More specifically, using our framework, we discovered two complementary efficient constructions for generating so-called Spatially Balanced Latin squares (SBLS) of any order N, such that 2N+1 is prime. Previously constructions for SBLSs were not known. Our approach also enabled us to derive a new lower bound for so-called weak Schur numbers, improving on a series of earlier results for Schur numbers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In maintaining consistencies, such as GAC<em>, FDGAC</em> and weak EDGAC*, for global cost functions, Weighted CSP (WCSP) solvers rely on the projection and extension operations, which entail the computation of the cost functions' minima.  Tractability of this minimum computation is essential for efficient execution. Since projections/extensions modify the cost functions, an important issue is  tractable projection-safety , concerning whether minimum cost computation remains tractable after projections/extensions. In this paper, we prove that tractable projection-safety is always  possible  for projections/extensions to/from the nullary cost function ( W  0 ), and always  impossible  for projections/extensions to/from  n -ary cost functions for  n  &gt; = 2.  When  n  = 1, the answer is indefinite.  We give a simple negative example, while Lee and Leung's flow-based projection-safe cost functions are also tractable projection-safe. We propose  polynomially decomposable  cost functions, which are amenable to tractable minimum computation.  We further prove that the polynomial decomposability property is unaffected by projections/extensionsto/from unary cost functions.  Thus, polynomially decomposable cost functions are tractable projection-safe.  We show that the SOFT_AMONG, SOFT_REGULAR, SOFT_GRAMMAR and MAX_WEIGHT/MIN_WEIGHT are polynomially decomposable.  They are embedded in a WCSP solver for extensive experiments to confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal.</p>

Korf, Reid and Edelkamp initiated a line of research for developing methods (KRE and later CDP) that predict the number of nodes expanded by IDA<em> for a given start state and cost bound. Independent of that, Chen developed a method (SS) that can also be used to predict the number of nodes expanded by IDA</em>. In this paper we advance both of these prediction methods. First, we develop a variant of CDP that can be orders of magnitude faster than CDP while producing exactly the same predictions. Second, we show how ideas developed in the KRE line of research can be used to substantially improve the predictions produced by SS. Third, we make an empirical comparison between our new enhanced versions of CDP and SS. Our experimental results point out that CDP is suitable for applications that require less accurate but very fast predictions, while SS is suitable for applications that require more accurate predictions but allow more computation time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently a logic programming language AC was proposed by Mellarkod et al. (2008) to integrate answer set programming (ASP) and constraint logic programming. Similarly, Gebser et al. (2009) proposed a CLINGCON language integrating ASP and finite domain constraints. These languages allow new efficient inference algorithms that combine traditional ASP procedures and other methods in constraint programming. In this paper we show that a transition system introduced by Nieuwenhuis et al. (2006) to model SAT solvers can be extended to model the "hybrid" Acsolver algorithm by Mellarkod et al. developed for simple AC programs and the Clingcon algorithm by Gebser et al. for clingcon programs. We define weakly-simple programs and show how the introduced transition systems generalize the Acsolver and Clingcon algorithms to such programs. Finally, we state the precise relation between AC and CLINGCON languages and the Acsolver and Clingcon algorithms.</p>

The Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) algorithm is a well-known near-optimal strategy for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Its extensions to trees, such as the Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) algorithm, have resulted in good solutions to the problem of Go. This paper introduces DUCT, a distributed algorithm inspired by UCT, for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP). Bounds on the solution quality are provided, and experiments show that, compared to existing DCOP approaches, DUCT is able to solve very large problems much more efficiently, or to find significantly higher quality solutions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Table constraints are very important in constraint programming as they are present in many real problems from areas such as configuration and databases. As a result, numerous specialized algorithms that achieve generalized arc consistency (GAC) on table constraints have been proposed. Since these algorithms achieve GAC, they operate on one constraint at a time. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for table constraints that achieves a stronger local consistency than GAC. This algorithm, called maxRPWC+, is based on the local consistency maxRPWC and allows the efficient handling of intersecting table constraints. Experimental results from benchmark problems demonstrate that maxRPWC+ is clearly more robust than a state-of-the-art GAC algorithm in classes of problems with interleaved table constraints, being orders of magnitude faster in some of these classes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A key challenge in developing efficient local search solvers is to effectively minimise search stagnation (i.e. avoiding traps or local minima). A majority of the state-of-the-art local search solvers perform random and/or Novelty-based walks to overcome search stagnation. Although such strategies are effective in diversifying a search from its current local minimum, they do not actively prevent the search from visiting previously encountered local minima. In this paper, we propose a new preventative strategy to effectively minimise search stagnation using pseudo-conflict learning. We define a pseudo-conflict as a derived path from the search trajectory that leads to a local minimum. We then introduce a new variable selection scheme that penalises variables causing those pseudo-conflicts. Our experimental results show that the new preventative approach significantly improves the performance of local search solvers on a wide range of structured and random benchmarks.</p>

Alpha-Beta pruning is one of the most powerful and fundamental MiniMax search improvements. It was designed for sequential two-player zero-sum perfect information games. In this paper we introduce an Alpha-Beta-like sound pruning method for the more general class of “stacked matrix games” that allow for simultaneous moves by both players. This is accomplished by maintaining upper and lower bounds for achievable payoffs in states with simultaneous actions and dominated action pruning based on the feasibility of certain linear programs. Empirical data shows considerable savings in terms of expanded nodes compared to naive depth-first move computation without pruning.</p>

In the multi agent path finding problem (MAPF) paths should be found for several agents, each with a different start and goal position such that agents do not collide. Previous optimal solvers applied global A<em>-based searches. We present a new search algorithm called Conflict Based Search (CBS). CBS is a two-level algorithm. At the high level, a search is performed on a tree based on conflicts between agents. At the low level, a search is performed only for a single agent at a time. In many cases this reformulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A</em> while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks. Experimental results on various problems shows a speedup of up to a full order of magnitude over previous approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
UCT, a state-of-the art algorithm for Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in games and Markov decision processes, is based on UCB, a sampling policy for the Multi-armed Bandit problem (MAB) that minimizes the cumulative regret. However, search differs from MAB in that in MCTS it is usually only the final <code>arm pull'' (the actual move selection) that collects a reward, rather than all</code>arm pulls''. Therefore, it makes more sense to minimize the simple regret, as opposed to the cumulative regret. We begin by introducing policies for multi-armed bandits with lower finite-time and asymptotic simple regret than UCB, using it to develop a two-stage scheme (SR+CR) for MCTS which outperforms UCT empirically. Optimizing the sampling process is itself a metareasoning problem, a solution of which can use value of information (VOI) techniques. Although the theory of VOI for search exists, applying it to MCTS is non-trivial, as typical myopic assumptions fail. Lacking a complete working VOI theory for MCTS, we nevertheless propose a sampling scheme that is ``aware'' of VOI, achieving an algorithm that in empirical evaluation outperforms both UCT and the other proposed algorithms.</p>

The Word-RAM is a model of computation that takes into account the capacity of a computer to manipulate a word of w bits with a single instruction. Many modern constraint solvers use a bitset data structure to encode the values contained in the variable domains. Using the algorithmic techniques developed for the Word-RAM, we propose new filtering algorithms that can prune Opwq values from a domain in a single instruction. Experiments show that on a processor with w = 64, the new filtering algorithms that enforce domain consis- tency on the constraints A + B = C, |A - B| = C and ALL-DIFFERENT can offer a speed up of a factor 10.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Uniform random 3-SAT at the solubility phase transition is one of the most widely studied and empirically hardest distributions of SAT instances. For 20 years, this distribution has been used extensively for evaluating and comparing algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that simple rules can predict the solubility of these instances with surprisingly high accuracy. Specifically, we show how classification accuracies of about 70% can be obtained based on cheaply (polynomial-time) computable features on a wide range of instance sizes. We argue in two ways that classification accuracy does not decrease with instance size: first, we show that our models' predictive accuracy remains roughly constant across a wide range of problem sizes; second, we show that a classifier trained on small instances is sufficient to achieve very accurate predictions across the entire range of instance sizes currently solvable by complete methods. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple decision tree based on only two features, and again trained only on the smallest instances, achieves predictive accuracies close to those of our most complex model. We conjecture that this two-feature model outperforms random guessing asymptotically; due to the model's extreme simplicity, we believe that this conjecture is a worthwhile direction for future theoretical work.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Influence maximization is a problem of finding a small set of highly influential users in a social network such that the spread of influence under certain propagation models is maximized. In this paper, we consider time-critical influence maximization, in which one wants to maximize influence spread within a given deadline. Since timing is considered in the optimization, we also extend the Independent Cascade (IC) model to incorporate the time delay aspect of influence diffusion in social networks. We show that time-critical influence maximization under the time-delayed IC model maintains desired properties such as submodularity, which allows a greedy algorithm to achieve an approximation ratio of 1-1/e, to circumvent the NP-hardness of the problem. To overcome the inefficiency of the approximation algorithm, we design two heuristic algorithms: the first one is based on a dynamic programming procedure that computes exact influence in tree structures, while the second one converts the problem to one in the original IC model and then applies existing fast heuristics to it. Our simulation results demonstrate that our heuristics achieve the same level of influence spread as the greedy algorithm while running a few orders of magnitude faster, and they also outperform existing algorithms that disregard the deadline constraint and delays in diffusion.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In digital libraries, a table, as a specific document component as well as a condensed way to present structured and relational data, contains rich information and often the only source of .that information. In order to explore, retrieve, and reuse that data, tables should be identified and the data extracted. Table recognition is an old field of research. However, due to the diversity of table styles, the results are still far from satisfactory, and not a single algorithm performs well on all different types of tables. In this paper, we randomly take samples from the CiteSeerX to investigate diverse table styles for automatic table extraction. We find that table headers are one of the main characteristics of complex table styles. We identify a set of features that can be used to segregate headers from tabular data and build a classifier to detect table headers. Our empirical evaluation on PDF documents shows that using a Random Forest classifier achieves an accuracy of 92%.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we address the problem of automatically generating human-like descriptions for unseen images, given a collection of images and their corresponding human-generated descriptions. Previous attempts for this task mostly rely on visual clues and corpus statistics, but do not take much advantage of the semantic information inherent in the available image descriptions. Here, we present a generic method which benefits from all these three sources (i.e. visual clues, corpus statistics and available descriptions) simultaneously, and is capable of constructing novel descriptions. Our approach works on syntactically and linguistically motivated phrases extracted from the human descriptions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our formulation mostly generates lucid and semantically correct descriptions, and significantly outperforms the previous methods on automatic evaluation metrics. One of the significant advantages of our approach is that we can generate multiple interesting descriptions for an image. Unlike any previous work, we also test the applicability of our method on a large dataset containing complex images with rich descriptions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The advent of the Web of Data kindled interest in link-traversal (or lookup-based) query processing methods, with which queries are answered via dereferencing a potentially large number of small, interlinked sources. While several algorithms for query evaluation have been proposed, there exists no notion of completeness for results of so-evaluated queries. In this paper, we motivate the need for clearly-defined completeness classes and present several notions of completeness for queries over Linked Data, based on the idea of authoritativeness of sources, and show the relation between the different completeness classes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Document summarization is of great value to many real world applications, such as snippets generation for search results and news headlines generation. Traditionally, document summarization is implemented by extracting sentences that cover the main topics of a document with a minimum redundancy. In this paper, we take a different perspective from data reconstruction and propose a novel framework named Document Summarization based on Data Reconstruction (DSDR). Specifically, our approach generates a summary which consist of those sentences that can best reconstruct the original document. To model the relationship among sentences, we introduce two objective functions: (1) linear reconstruction, which approximates the document by linear combinations of the selected sentences; (2) nonnegative linear reconstruction, which allows only additive, not subtractive, linear combinations. In this framework, the reconstruction error becomes a natural criterion for measuring the quality of the summary. For each objective function, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experiments on summarization benchmark data sets DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
With the growing popularity of social networks and collaboration systems, people are increasingly working with or socially connected with each other. Unified messaging system provides a single interface for users to receive and process information from multiple sources. It is highly desirable to design attention management solution that can help users easily navigate and process dozens of unread messages from a unified message system. Moreover, with the proliferation of mobile devices people are now selectively consuming the most important messages on the go between different activities in their daily life. The information overload problem is especially acute for mobile users with small screen to display. In this paper, we present \PAM, an intelligent end-to-end Personalized Attention Management solution that employs analytical techniques that can learn user interests and organize and prioritize incoming messages based on user interests. For a list of unread messages, \PAM generates a concise attention report that allows users to quickly scan the important new messages from his important social connections as well as messages about his most important tasks that the user is involved with. Our solution can also be applied in other applications such as news filtering and alerts on mobile devices. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of \PAM.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Hashing, which tries to learn similarity-preserving binary codes for data representation, has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive databases due to its fast query speed and low storage cost. Because it is NP hard to directly compute the best binary codes for a given data set, mainstream hashing methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, several projected dimensions of real values are generated. Then in the second stage, the real values will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding. Currently, most existing methods use one single bit to quantize each projected dimension. One problem with this single-bit quantization (SBQ) is that the threshold typically lies in the region of the highest point density and consequently a lot of neighboring points close to the threshold will be hashed to totally different bits, which is unexpected according to the principle of hashing. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization strategy, called double-bit quantization (DBQ), to solve the problem of SBQ. The basic idea of DBQ is to quantize each projected dimension into double bits with adaptively learned thresholds. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that our DBQ strategy can significantly outperform traditional SBQ strategy for hashing.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
High dimensional nearest neighbor search is a fundamental problem and has found applications in many domains. Although many hashing based approaches have been proposed for approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensional space, one main drawback is that they often return many false positives that need to be filtered out by a post procedure. We propose a novel method to address this limitation in this paper. The key idea is to introduce a filtering procedure within the search algorithm, based on the compressed sensing theory, that effectively removes the false positive answers. We first obtain a sparse representation for each data point by the landmark based approach, after which we solve the nearly duplicate search that the difference between the query and its nearest neighbors forms a sparse vector living in a small ℓp ball, where p ≤ 1. Our empirical study on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Most Twitter search systems generally treat a tweet as a plain text when modeling relevance. However, a series of conventions allows users to tweet in structural ways using combination of different blocks of texts.These blocks include plain texts, hashtags, links, mentions, etc. Each block encodes a variety of communicative intent and sequence of these blocks captures changing discourse. Previous work shows that exploiting the structural information can improve the structured document (e.g., web pages) retrieval. In this paper we utilize the structure of tweets, induced by these blocks, for Twitter retrieval. A set of features, derived from the blocks of text and their combinations, is used into a learning-to-rank scenario. We show that structuring tweets can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our approach does not rely upon social media features, but when we do add this additional information, performance improves significantly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As an emerging machine learning and information retrieval technique, the matrix completion has been successfully applied to solve many scientific applications, such as collaborative prediction in information retrieval, video completion in computer vision, \emph{etc}. The matrix completion is to recover a low-rank matrix with a fraction of its entries arbitrarily corrupted. Instead of solving the popularly used trace norm or nuclear norm based objective, we directly minimize the original formulations of trace norm and rank norm. We propose a novel Schatten $p$-Norm optimization framework that unifies different norm formulations. An efficient algorithm is derived to solve the new objective and followed by the rigorous theoretical proof on the convergence. The previous main solution strategy for this problem requires computing singular value decompositions - a task that requires increasingly cost as matrix sizes and rank increase. Our algorithm has closed form solution in each iteration, hence it converges fast. As a consequence, our algorithm has the capacity of solving large-scale matrix completion problems. Empirical studies on the recommendation system data sets demonstrate the promising performance of our new optimization framework and efficient algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
To solve the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering, researchers have introduced transfer learning as a viable approach to make use of auxiliary data.  Most previous transfer learning works in collaborative filtering have focused on exploiting point-wise ratings such as numerical ratings, stars, or binary ratings of likes/dislikes. However, in many real-world recommender systems, many users may be unwilling or unlikely to rate items with precision.In contrast, practitioners can turn to various non-preference data to estimate a range or rating distribution of a user's preference on an item.Such a range or rating distribution is called an uncertain rating since it represents a rating spectrum of uncertainty instead of an accurate point-wise score. In this paper, we propose an efficient transfer learning solution for collaborative filtering, known as {\em transfer by integrative factorization} (TIF), to leverage such auxiliary uncertain ratings to improve the performance of recommendation. In particular, we integrate auxiliary data of uncertain ratings as additional constraints in the target matrix factorization problem, and learn an expected rating value for each uncertain rating automatically. The advantages of our proposed approach include the efficiency and the improved effectiveness of collaborative filtering, showing that incorporating the auxiliary data of uncertain ratings can really bring a benefit. Experimental results on two movie recommendation tasks show that our TIF algorithm performs significantly better over a state-of-the-art non-transfer learning method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
How do reasoning systems that learn evolve over time? What are the properties of different learning strategies? Characterizing the evolution of these systems is important for understanding their limitations and gaining insights into the interplay between learning and reasoning. We describe an inverse ablation model for studying how large knowledge-based systems evolve: Create a small knowledge base by ablating a large KB, and simulate learning by incrementally re-adding facts, using different strategies to simulate types of learners. For each iteration, reasoning properties (including number of questions answered and run time) are collected, to explore how learning strategies and reasoning interact. We describe several experiments with the inverse ablation model, examining how two different learning strategies perform. Our results suggest that different concepts show different rates of growth, and that the density and distribution of facts that can be learned are important parameters for modulating the rate of learning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a novel sequential decision approach to modeling ordinal ratings in collaborative filtering problems. The rating process is assumed to start from the lowest level, evaluates against the latent utility at the corresponding level and moves up until a suitable ordinal level is found. Crucial to this generative process is the underlying utility random variables that govern the generation of ratings and their modelling choices. To this end, we make a novel use of the generalised extreme value distributions, which is found to be particularly suitable for our modeling tasks and at the same time, facilitate our inference and learning procedure. The proposed approach is flexible to incorporate features from both the user and the item. We evaluate the proposed framework on three well-known datasets: MovieLens, Dating Agency and Netflix. In all cases, it is demonstrated that the proposed work is competitive against state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper introduces a novel framework for generating pictorial storylines for given topics from text and image data on the Internet. Unlike traditional text summarization and timeline generation systems, the proposed framework combines text and image analysis and delivers a storyline containing textual, pictorial, and structural information to provide a sketch of the topic evolution. A key idea in the framework is the use of an approximate solution for the dominating set problem. Given a collection of topic-related objects consisting of images and their text descriptions, a weighted multi-view graph is first constructed to capture the contextual and temporal relationships among these objects. Then the objects are selected by solving the minimum-weighted connected dominating set problem defined on this graph. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The study of transportability aims to identify conditions under which causal information learned from experiments can be reused in a different environment where only passive observations can be collected. The theory introduced in   [Pearl   and Bareinboim, 2011] (henceforth [PB, 2011]) defines formal conditions for such transfer but falls short of providing an effective procedure for deciding, given assumptions about differences between the source and target domains, whether transportability is feasible. This paper provides such procedure. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target domain are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments. The paper further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of fusing experimental and observational information to synthesize an estimate of the desired causal relation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Consistent query answering is a standard approach for producing meaningful query answers when data is inconsistent. Recent work on consistent query answering in the presence of ontologies has shown this problem to be intractable in data complexity even for ontologies expressed in lightweight description logics. In order to better understand the source of this intractability, we investigate the complexity of consistent query answering for simple ontologies consisting only of class subsumption and class disjointness axioms. We show that for conjunctive queries with at most one quantified variable, the problem is first-order expressible; for queries with at most two quantified variables, the problem has polynomial data complexity but may not be first-order expressible; and for three quantified variables, the problem may become co-NP-hard in data complexity. For queries having at most two quantified variables, we further identify a necessary and sufficient condition for first-order expressibility. In order to be able to handle arbitrary conjunctive queries, we propose a novel inconsistency-tolerant semantics and show that under this semantics, first-order expressibility is always guaranteed. We conclude by extending our positive results to  DL-Lite ontologies without inverse.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given a partially observable dynamic system and a diagnoser observing its evolution over time, diagnosability analysis formally verifies (at design time) if the diagnosis system will be able to infer (at runtime) the required information on the hidden part of the dynamic state. Diagnosability directly depends on the availability of observations, and can be guaranteed by different sets of sensors, possibly associated with different costs. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesizing observability requirements, i.e. automatically discovering a set of observations that is sufficient to guarantee diagnosability. We propose a novel approach with the following characterizing features. First, it fully covers a comprehensive formal framework for diagnosability analysis, and enables ranking configurations of observables in terms of cost, minimality, and diagnosability delay. Second, we propose two complementary algorithms for the synthesis of observables. Third, we describe an efficient implementation that takes full advantage of mature symbolic model checking techniques. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated over a comprehensive suite of benchmarks taken from the aerospace domain.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper we introduce the notion of mapping-based knowledge base (MKB) to formalize the situation where both the extensional and the intensional level of the ontology are determined by suitable mappings to a set of (relational) data sources. This allows for making the intensional level of the ontology as dynamic as traditionally the extensional level is. To do so, we resort to the meta-modeling capabilities of higher-order Description Logics, which allow us to see concepts and roles as individuals, and vice versa. The challenge in this setting is to design tractable query answering algorithms. Besides the definition of MKBs, our main result is that answering instance queries posed to MKBs expressed in Hi(DL-LiteR) can be done efficiently. In particular, we define a query rewriting technique that produces first-order (SQL) queries to be posed to the data sources.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Query answering over Description Logic (DL) ontologies has become a vibrant field of research. Efficient realizations often exploit database technology and rewrite a given query to an equivalent SQL or Datalog query over a database associated with the ontology. This approach has been intensively studied for conjunctive query answering in the DL-Lite and EL families, but is much less explored for more expressive DLs and queries. We present a rewriting-based algorithm for conjunctive query answering over Horn-SHIQ ontologies, possibly extended with recursive rules under limited recursion as in DL+log. This setting not only subsumes both DL-Lite and EL, but also yields an algorithm for answering (limited) recursive queries over Horn-SHIQ ontologies (an undecidable problem for full recursive queries). A prototype implementation shows its potential for applications, as experiments exhibit efficient query answering over full Horn-SHIQ ontologies and benign downscaling to DL-Lite, where it is competitive with comparable state of the art systems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
While founded on the situation calculus, current implementations of Golog are mainly based on the closed-world assumption or its dynamic versions or the domain closure assumption. Also, they are almost exclusively based on regression. In this paper, we propose a first-order interpreter for knowledge-based Golog with sensing based on exact progression and limited reasoning. We assume infinitely many unique names and handle first-order disjunctive information in the form of the so-called proper+ KBs. Our implementation is based on the progression and limited reasoning algorithms for proper+ KBs proposed by Liu, Lakemeyer and Levesque. To improve efficiency, we implement the two algorithms by grounding via a trick based on the unique name assumption. The interpreter is online but the programmer can use two operators to specify offline execution for parts of programs. The search operator returns a conditional plan, while the planning operator is used when local closed-world information is available and calls a modern planner to generate a sequence of actions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Abduction belongs to the most fundamental reasoning methods. It is a method for reverse inference, this means one is interested in explaining observed behavior by finding appropriate causes. We study logic-based abduction, where knowledge is represented by propositional formulas. The computational complexity of this problem is highly intractable in many interesting settings. In this work we therefore present an extensive parameterized complexity analysis of abduction within various fragments of propositional logic together with (combinations of) natural parameters.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Inferring probabilistic networks from data is a notoriously difficult task. Under various goodness-of-fit measures, finding an optimal network is NP-hard, even if restricted to polytrees of bounded in-degree. Polynomial-time algorithms are known only for rare special cases, perhaps most notably for branchings, that is, polytrees in which the in-degree of every node is at most one. Here, we study the complexity of finding an optimal polytree that can be turned into a branching by deleting some number of arcs or nodes, treated as a parameter. We show that the problem can be solved via a matroid intersection formulation in polynomial time if the number of deleted arcs is bounded by a constant. The order of the polynomial time bound depends on this constant, hence the algorithm does not establish fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the number of deleted arcs. We show that a restricted version of the problem allows fixed-parameter tractability and hence scales well with the parameter. We contrast this positive result by showing that if we parameterize by the number of deleted nodes, a somewhat more powerful parameter, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable, subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We tackle the problem of defining a well-founded semantics for Datalog rules with existentially quantified variables in their heads and negations in their bodies. In particular, we provide a well-founded semantics (WFS) for the recent Datalog+/- family of ontology languages, which covers several important description logics (DLs). To do so, we generalize Datalog+/- by non-stratified nonmonotonic negation in rule bodies, and we define a WFS for this generalization via guarded fixed-point logic. We refer to this approach as equality-friendly WFS, since it has the advantage that it does not make the unique name assumption (UNA); this brings it close to OWL and its profiles as well as typical DLs, which also do not make the UNA. We prove that for guarded Datalog+/- with negation under the equality-friendly WFS, conjunctive query answering is decidable, and we provide precise complexity results for this problem. From these results, we obtain precise definitions of the standard WFS extensions of EL and of members of the DL-Lite family, as well as corresponding complexity results for query answering.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A probabilistic variant of ATL* logic is proposed to work with multi-player games of incomplete information and synchronous perfect recall. The semantics of the logic is settled over probabilistic interpreted system and partially observed probabilistic concurrent game structure. While unexpectedly, the model checking problem is in general undecidable even for single-group fragment, we find a fragment whose complexity is in 2-EXPTIME. The usefulness of this fragment is shown over a land search scenario.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Query rewriting is a prominent reasoning technique in ontology-based data access applications. A wide variety of query rewriting algorithms have been proposed in recent years and implemented in highly optimised reasoning systems. Query rewriting systems are complex software programs; even if based on provably correct algorithms, sophisticated optimisations make the systems more complex and errors become more likely to happen. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given an ontology as input, synthetically generates <code>relevant'' test queries. Intuitively, each of these queries can be used to verify whether the system correctly performs a certain set of</code>inferences'', each of which can be traced back to axioms in the input ontology. Furthermore, we present techniques that allow us to determine whether a system is unsound and/or incomplete for a given test query and ontology. Our evaluation shows that most publicly available query rewriting systems are unsound and/or incomplete, even on commonly used benchmark ontologies; more importantly, our techniques revealed the precise causes of their correctness issues and the systems were then corrected based on our feedback. Finally, since our evaluation is based on a larger set of test queries than existing benchmarks, which are based on hand-crafted queries, it also provides a better understanding of the scalability behaviour of each system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Temporal Action Logics (TAL) is a class of temporal logics for reasoning about actions. We present a reformulation of TAL in Answer Set Programming (ASP), and discuss some synergies it brings. First, the reformulation provides a means to compute TAL using efficient answer set solvers. Second, TAL provides a structured high-level language for ASP (possibly with constraint solving). Third, the reformulation allows us to compute integration of TAL and ontologies using answer set solvers, and we illustrate its usefulness in the healthcare domain in the context of medical expert systems.</p>

This paper introduces an encoding of Model Based Diagnosis (MBD) to Boolean Satisfaction (SAT) focusing on minimal cardinality diagnosis. The encoding is based on a combination of sophisticated MBD preprocessing algorithms and SAT compilation techniques which together provide concise CNF formula. Experimental evidence indicates that our approach is superior to all published algorithms for minimal cardinality MBD. In particular, we can determine, for the first time, minimal cardinality diagnoses for the entire standard ISCAS-85 benchmark. Our results open the way to improve the state-of-the-art on a range of similar MBD problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we investigate belief revision in possibilistic logic, which is a weighted logic proposed to deal with incomplete and uncertain information. Existing revision operators in possibilistic logic are restricted in the sense that the input information can only be a formula instead of a possibilistic knowledge base which is a set of weighted formulas. To break this restriction, we consider weighted prime implicants of a possibilistic knowledge base and use them to define novel revision operators in possibilistic logic. Intuitively, a weighted prime implicant of a possibilistic knowledge base is a logically weakest possibilistic term (i.e., a set of weighted literals) that can entail the knowledge base. We first show that the existing definition of a weighted prime implicant is problematic and need a modification. To define a revision operator using weighted prime implicants, we face two problems. The first problem is that we need to define the notion of a conflict set between two weighted prime implicants of two possibilistic knowledge bases to achieve minimal change. The second problem is that we need to define the disjunction of possibilistic terms. We solve these problems and define two conflict-based revision operators in possibilistic logic. We then adapt the well-known postulates for revision proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon and show that our revision operators satisfy four of the basic adapted postulates and satisfy two others in some special cases.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The task of automatically determining the correct sense of a polysemous word has remained a challenge to this day. In our research, we introduce Concept-Based Disambiguation (CBD), a novel framework that utilizes recent semantic analysis techniques to represent both the context of the word and its senses in a high-dimensional space of natural concepts. The concepts are retrieved from a vast encyclopedic resource, thus enriching the disambiguation process with large amounts of domain-specific knowledge. In such concept-based spaces, more comprehensive measures can be applied in order to pick the right sense. Additionally, we introduce a novel representation scheme, denoted anchored representation, that builds a more specific text representation associated with an anchoring word. We evaluate our framework and show that the anchored representation is more suitable to the task of word-sense disambiguation (WSD). Additionally, we show that our system is superior to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on domain-specific corpora, and competitive with recent methods when evaluated on a general corpus.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Much work has been done on predicting where is one going to be in the immediate future, typically within the next hour. By contrast, we address the open problem of predicting human mobility far into the future, a scale of months and years. We propose an efficient nonparametric method that extracts significant and robust patterns in location data, learns their associations with contextual features (such as day of week), and subsequently leverages this information to predict the most likely location at any given time in the future. The entire process is formulated in a principled way as an eigendecomposition problem. Evaluation on a massive dataset with more than 32,000 days worth of GPS data across 703 diverse subjects shows that our model predicts the correct location with high accuracy, even years into the future. This result opens a number of interesting avenues for future research and applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The FLP semantics presented by (Faber, Leone, and Pfeifer 2004) has been widely used to define answer sets, called FLP answer sets, for different types of logic programs such as logic programs with aggregates, description logic programs (dl-programs), Hex programs, and logic programs with first-order formulas (general logic programs). However, it was recently observed that the FLP semantics may produce unintuitive answer sets with circular justifications caused by self-supporting loops. In this paper, we address the circular justification problem for general logic programs by enhancing the FLP semantics with a level mapping formalism. In particular, we extend the Gelfond-Lifschitz three step definition of the standard answer set semantics from normal logic programs to general logic programs and define for general logic programs the first FLP semantics that is free of circular justifications. We call this FLP semantics the well-justified FLP semantics. This method naturally extends to general logic programs with additional constraints like aggregates, thus providing a unifying framework for defining the well-justified FLP semantics for various types of logic programs. When this method is applied to normal logic programs with aggregates, the well-justified FLP semantics agrees with the conditional satisfaction based semantics defined by (Son, Pontelli, and Tu 2007); and when applied to dl-programs, the semantics agrees with the strongly well-supported semantics defined by (Shen 2011).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A model-based diagnosis problem occurs when an observation is inconsistent with the assumption that the diagnosed system is not faulty. The task of a diagnosis engine is to compute diagnoses, which are assumptions on the health of components in the diagnosed system that explain the observation. In this paper, we extend Reiter's well-known theory of diagnosis by exploiting the duality of the relation between conflicts and diagnoses. This duality means that a diagnosis is a hitting set of conflicts, but a conflict is also a hitting set of diagnoses. We use this property to interleave the search for diagnoses and conflicts: a set of conflicts can guide the search for diagnosis, and the computed diagnoses can guide the search for more conflicts. We provide the formal basis for this dual conflict-diagnosis relation, and propose a novel diagnosis algorithm that exploits this duality. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is able to find a minimal cardinality diagnosis faster than the well-known Conflict-Directed A*.</p>

Logic programs with abstract constraint atoms proposed by Marek and Truszczynski are very general logic programs.They are general enough to captureaggregate logic programs as well asrecently proposed description logic programs.In this paper, we propose a well-founded semantics for basic logic programs with arbitrary abstract constraint atoms, which are sets of rules whose heads have exactly one atom. Weshow that similar to the well-founded semanticsof normal logic programs, it has many desirable properties such as that it can becomputed in polynomial time, and is always correct with respect to theanswer set semantics. This paves the way for using our well-founded semanticsto simplify these logic programs. We also show how our semantics can be applied toaggregate logic programs and description logic programs, and compare itto the well-founded semantics already proposed for these logic programs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) is a recently proposed representation of Boolean functions, containing Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) as a distinguished subclass. While OBDDs are characterized by total variable orders, SDDs are characterized by dissections of variable orders, known as vtrees. Despite this generality, SDDs retain a number of properties, such as canonicity and a polytime apply operator, that have been critical to the practical success of OBDDs. Moreover, upper bounds on the size of SDDs were also given, which are tighter than comparable upper bounds on the size of OBDDs. In this paper, we analyze more closely some of the theoretical properties of SDDs and their size. In particular, we consider the impact of basing decisions on sentences (using dissections as in SDDs), in comparison to basing decisions on variables (using total variable orders as in OBDDs). Here, we identify a class of Boolean functions where basing decisions on sentences using dissections of a variable order can lead to exponentially more compact SDDs, compared to OBDDs based on the same variable order. Moreover, we identify a fundamental property of the decompositions that underlie SDDs and use it to show how certain changes to a vtree can also lead to exponential differences in the size of an SDD.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The rising popularity of the sensor-equipped smartphone is changing the possible scale and scope of human activity inference. The diversity in user population seen in large user bases can overwhelm conventional one-size-fits-all classiﬁcation approaches. Although personalized models are better able to handle population diversity, they often require increased effort from the end user during training and are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an activity classification framework that is scalable and can tractably handle an increasing number of users. Scalability is achieved by maintaining distinct groups of similar users during the training process, which makes it possible to account for the differences between users without resorting to training individualized classifiers. The proposed framework keeps user burden low by leveraging crowd-sourced data labels, where simple natural language processing techniques in combination with multi-instance learning are used to handle labeling errors introduced by low-commitment everyday users. Experiment results on a large public dataset demonstrate that the framework can cope with population diversity irrespective of population size.</p>

We investigate a natural generalization of the classical clustering problem, considering clustering tasks in which different instances may have different weights. We conduct the first extensive theoretical analysis on the influence of weighted data on standard clustering algorithms in both the partitional and hierarchical settings, characterizing the conditions under which algorithms react to weights. Extending a recent framework for clustering algorithm selection, we propose intuitive properties that would allow users to choose between clustering algorithms in the weighted setting and classify algorithms accordingly.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Contingency awareness is the recognition that some aspects of a future observation are under an agent's control while others are solely determined by the environment.  This paper explores the idea of contingency awareness in reinforcement learning using the platform of Atari 2600 games.  We introduce a technique for accurately identifying contingent regions and describe how to exploit this knowledge to generate improved features for value function approximation.  We evaluate the performance of our techniques empirically, using 46 unseen, diverse, and challenging games for the Atari 2600 console.  Our results suggest that contingency awareness is a generally useful concept for model-free reinforcement learning agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The step-size, often denoted as α, is a key parameter for most incremental learning algorithms. Its importance is especially pronounced when performing online temporal difference (TD) learning with function approximation. Several methods have been developed to adapt the step-size online. These range from straightforward back-off strategies to adaptive algorithms based on gradient descent. We derive an adaptive upper bound on the step-size parameter to guarantee that online TD learning with linear function approximation will not diverge. We then empirically evaluate algorithms using this upper bound as a heuristic for adapting the step-size parameter online. We compare performance with related work including HL(λ) and Autostep. Our results show that this adaptive upper bound heuristic out-performs all existing methods without requiring any meta-parameters. This effectively eliminates the need to tune the learning rate of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Traditional clustering algorithms are designed to search for a single clustering solution despite the fact that multiple alternative solutions might exist for a particular dataset. For example, a set of news articles might be clustered by topic or by the author's gender or age. Similarly, book reviews might be clustered by sentiment or comprehensiveness. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying alternative clustering solutions by developing a Probabilistic Multi-Clustering (PMC) model that discovers multiple, maximally different clusterings of a data sample. Empirical results on six datasets representative of real-world applications show that our PMC model exhibits superior performance to comparable multi-clustering algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study the problem of finding efficient exploration policies for the case in which an agent is momentarily not concerned with exploiting, and instead tries to compute a policy for later use. We first formally define the Optimal Exploration Problem as one of sequential sampling and show that its solutions correspond to paths of minimum expected length in the space of policies. We derive a model-free, local linear approximation to such solutions and use it to construct efficient exploration policies. We compare our model-free approach to other exploration techniques, including one with the best known PAC bounds, and show that ours is both based on a well-defined optimization problem and empirically efficient.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Kernelized sorting is a method for aligning objects across two domains by considering within-domain similarity, without a need to specify a cross-domain similarity measure. In this paper we present the Convex Kernelized Sorting method where, unlike in the previous approaches, the cross-domain object matching is formulated as a convex optimization problem, leading to simpler optimization and global optimum solution. Our method outputs soft alignments between objects, which can be used to rank the best matches for each object, or to visualize the object matching and verify the correct choice of the kernel. It also allows for computing hard one-to-one alignments by solving the resulting Linear Assignment Problem. Experiments on a number of cross-domain matching tasks show the strength of the proposed method, which consistently achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Current modularity-based community detection methods show decreased performance as relational networks become increasingly noisy. These methods also yield a large number of diverse community structures as solutions, which is problematic for applications that impose constraints on the acceptable solutions or in cases where the user is focused on specific communities of interest. To address both of these problems, we develop a semi-supervised spin-glass model that enables current community detection methods to incorporate background knowledge in the forms of individual labels and pairwise constraints. Unlike current methods, our approach shows robust performance in the presence of noise in the relational network, and the ability to guide the discovery process toward specific community structures. We evaluate our algorithm on several benchmark networks and a new political sentiment network representing cooperative events between nations that was mined from news articles over six years.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we address the problem of data description using a Bayesian framework. The goal of data description is to draw a boundary around objects of a certain class of interest to discriminate that class from the rest of the feature space. Data description is also known as one-class learning and has a wide range of applications. The proposed approach uses a Bayesian framework to precisely compute the class boundary and therefore can utilize domain information in form of prior knowledge in the framework. It can also operate in the kernel space and therefore recognize arbitrary boundary shapes. Moreover, the proposed method can utilize unlabeled data in order to improve accuracy of discrimination. We evaluate our method using various real-world datasets and compare it with other state of the art approaches of data description. Experiments show promising results and improved performance over other data description and one-class learning algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The existing classification-based policy iteration (CBPI) algorithms can be divided into two categories: direct policy iteration (DPI) methods that directly assign the output of the classifier (the approximate greedy policy w.r.t.~the current policy) to the next policy, and conservative policy iteration (CPI) methods in which the new policy is a mixture distribution of the current policy and the output of the classifier. The conservative policy update gives CPI a desirable feature, namely the guarantee that the policies generated by this algorithm improve at each iteration. We provide a detailed algorithmic and theoretical comparison of these two classes of CBPI algorithms. Our results reveal that in order to achieve the same level of accuracy, CPI requires more iterations, and thus, more samples than the DPI algorithm. Furthermore, CPI may converge to suboptimal policies whose performance is not better than DPI's.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The trust region step problem, by solving a sphere constrained quadratic programming, plays a critical role in the trust region Newton method. In this paper, we propose an efficient Multi-Stage Conjugate Gradient (MSCG) algorithm to compute the trust region step in a multi-stage manner. Specifically, when the iterative solution is in the interior of the sphere, we perform the conjugate gradient procedure. Otherwise, we perform a gradient descent procedure which points to the inner of the sphere and can make the next iterative solution be a interior point. Subsequently, we proceed with the conjugate gradient procedure again. We repeat the above procedures until convergence. We also present a theoretical analysis which shows that the MSCG algorithm converges. Moreover, the proposed MSCG algorithm can generate a solution in any prescribed precision controlled by a tolerance parameter which is the only parameter we need. Experimental results on large-scale text data sets demonstrate our proposed MSCG algorithm has a faster convergence speed compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Data sparsity is an emerging real-world problem observed in a various domains ranging from sensor networks to medical diagnosis. Consecutively, numerous machine learning methods were modeled to treat missing values. Nevertheless, sparsity, defined as missing segments, has not been thoroughly investigated in the context of time series classification. We propose a novel principle for classifying time series, which in contrast to existing approaches, avoids reconstructing the missing segments in time series and operates solely on the observed ones. Based on the proposed principle, we develop a method that prevents adding noise that incurs during the reconstruction of the original time series. Ourmethod adapts supervised matrix factorization by projecting time series in a latent space through stochasticlearning. Furthermore the projected data is built in a supervised fashion via a logistic regression. Abundant experiments on a large collection of 37 data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which in the majority of cases outperforms a set of baselines that do not follow our proposed principle.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The sparse principal component analysis is a variant of the classical principal component analysis, which finds linear combinations of a small number of features that maximize variance across data. In this paper we propose a methodology for adding two general types of feature grouping constraints into the original sparse PCA optimization procedure.We derive convex relaxations of the considered constraints, ensuring the convexity of the resulting optimization problem. Empirical evaluation on three real-world problems, one in process monitoring sensor networks and two in social networks, serves to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, training support vector machines with indefinite kernels has attracted great attention in the machine learning community. In this paper, we tackle this problem by formulating a joint optimization model over SVM classifications and kernel principal component analysis. We first reformulate the kernel principal component analysis as a general kernel transformation framework, and then incorporate it into the SVM classification to formulate a joint optimization model. The proposed model has the advantage of making consistent kernel transformations over training and test samples. It can be used for both binary classification and multi-class classification problems. Our experimental results on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets show the proposed model can significantly outperform related approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
It is well known that exploiting label correlations is important for multi-label learning. Existing approaches typically exploit label correlations globally, by assuming that the label correlations are shared by all the instances. In real-world tasks, however, different instances may share different label correlations, and few correlations are globally applicable. In this paper, we propose the ML-LOC approach which allows label correlations to be exploited locally. To encode the local influence of label correlations, we derive a LOC code to enhance the feature representation of each instance. The global discrimination fitting and local correlation sensitivity are incorporated into a unified framework, and an alternating solution is developed for the optimization. Experimental results on a number of image, text and gene data sets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A large family of graph-based semi-supervised algorithms have been developed intuitively and pragmatically for the multi-label learning problem. These methods, however, only implicitly exploited the label correlation, as either part of graph weight or an additional constraint, to improve overall classification performance. Despite their seemingly quite different formulations, we show that all existing approaches can be uniformly referred to as a Label Propagation (LP) or Random Walk with Restart (RWR) on a Cartesian Product Graph (CPG). Inspired by this discovery, we introduce a new framework for multi-label classification task, employing the Tensor Product Graph (TPG) — the tensor product of the data graph with the class (label) graph — in which not only the intra-class but also the inter-class associations are explicitly represented as weighted edges among graph vertices. In stead of computing directly on TPG, we derive an iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge and with the same computational complexity and the same amount of storage as the standard label propagation on the original data graph. Applications to four benchmark multi-label data sets illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In recent years, several systems have been proposed that learn the rules of a simple card or board game solely from visual demonstration. These systems were constructed for specific games and rely on substantial background knowledge. We introduce a general system for learning board game rules from videos and demonstrate it on several well-known games. The presented algorithm requires only a few demonstrations and minimal background knowledge, and, having learned the rules, automatically derives position evaluation functions and can play the learned games competitively. Our main technique is based on descriptive complexity, i.e. the logical means necessary to define a set of interest. We compute formulas defining allowed moves and final positions in a game in different logics and select the most adequate ones. We show that this method is well-suited for board games and there is strong theoretical evidence that it will generalize to other problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Common spatial patterns (CSP) is a popular feature extraction method for discriminating between positive andnegative classes in electroencephalography (EEG) data.Two probabilistic models for CSP were recently developed: probabilistic CSP (PCSP), which is trained by expectation maximization (EM), and variational BayesianCSP (VBCSP) which is learned by variational approx-imation. Parameter expansion methods use auxiliaryparameters to speed up the convergence of EM or thedeterministic approximation of the target distributionin variational inference. In this paper, we describethe development of parameter-expanded algorithms forPCSP and VBCSP, leading to PCSP-PX and VBCSP-PX, whose convergence speed-up and high performanceare emphasized. The convergence speed-up in PCSP-PX and VBCSP-PX is a direct consequence of parame-ter expansion methods. The contribution of this study is the performance improvement in the case of CSP,which is a novel development. Numerical experimentson the BCI competition datasets, III IV a and IV 2ademonstrate the high performance and fast convergenceof PCSP-PX and VBCSP-PX, as compared to PCSP andVBCSP.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are an established framework for solving sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. In this work, we propose a new method for batch-mode reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state variables. The method is an approximation to kernel-based RL on a set of k representative states. Similarly to kernel-based RL, our solution is a fixed point of a kernelized Bellman operator and can approximate the optimal solution to an arbitrary level of granularity. Unlike kernel-based RL, our method is fast. In particular, our policies can be computed in  O ( n ) time, where  n  is the number of training examples. The time complexity of kernel-based RL is Ω( n  2 ). We introduce our method, analyze its convergence, and compare it to existing work. The method is evaluated on two existing control problems with 2 to 4 continuous variables and a new problem with 64 variables. In all cases, we outperform state-of-the-art results and offer simpler solutions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Selecting the optimal kernel is an important and difficult challenge in applying kernel methods to pattern recognition. To address this challenge, multiple kernel learning (MKL) aims to learn a kernel from a combination of base kernel functions that perform optimally on the task. In this paper, we propose a novel MKL-themed approach to combine base kernels that are multiplicatively shaped with low-rank positive semidefinitve matrices. The proposed approach generalizes several popular MKL methods and thus provides more flexibility in modeling data. Computationally, we show how these low-rank matrices can be learned efficiently from data using convex quadratic programming. Empirical studies on several standard benchmark datasets for MKL show that the new approach often improves prediction accuracy statistically significantly over very competitive single kernel and other MKL methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Humans have an uncanny ability to learn new concepts with very few examples. Cognitive theories have suggested that this is done by utilizing prior experience of related tasks. We propose to emulate this process in machines, by transforming new problems into old ones. These transformations are called metaphors. Obviously, the learner is not given a metaphor, but must acquire one through a learning process. We show that learning metaphors yield better results than existing transfer learning methods. Moreover, we argue that metaphors give a qualitative assessment of task relatedness.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Cross-domain text classification aims to automatically train a precise text classifier for a target domain by using labeled text data from a related source domain. To this end, the distribution gap between different domains has to be reduced. In previous works, a certain number of shared latent features (e.g., latent topics, principal components, etc.) are extracted to represent documents from different domains, and thus reduce the distribution gap. However, only relying the shared latent features as the domain bridge may limit the amount of knowledge transferred. This limitation is more serious when the distribution gap is so large that only a small number of latent features can be shared between domains. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Topic Correlation Analysis (TCA), which extracts both the shared and the domain-specific latent features to facilitate effective knowledge transfer. In TCA, all word features are first grouped into the shared and the domain-specific topics using a joint mixture model. Then the correlations between the two kinds of topics are inferred and used to induce a mapping between the domain-specific topics from different domains. Finally, both the shared and the mapped domain-specific topics are utilized to span a new shared feature space where the supervised knowledge can be effectively transferred. The experimental results on two real-world data sets justify the superiority of the proposed method over the stat-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Probabilistic relational PCA (PRPCA) can learn a projection matrix to perform dimensionality reduction for relational data. However, the results learned by PRPCA lack interpretability because each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called sparse probabilistic relational projection (SPRP), to learn a sparse projection matrix for relational dimensionality reduction. The sparsity in SPRP is achieved by imposing on the projection matrix a sparsity-inducing prior such as the Laplace prior or Jeffreys prior. We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the parameters of SPRP. Compared with PRPCA, the sparsity in SPRP not only makes the results more interpretable but also makes the projection operation much more efficient without compromising its accuracy. All these are verified by experiments conducted on several real applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many real applications, especially those involving data objects with complicated semantics, it is generally desirable to discover the relation between patterns in the input space and labels corresponding to different semantics in the output space. This task becomes feasible with MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning), a recently developed learning framework, where each data object is represented by multiple instances and is allowed to be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose  KISAR , an MIML algorithm that is able to discover what instances trigger what labels. By considering the fact that highly relevant labels usually share some patterns, we develop a convex optimization formulation and provide an alternating optimization solution. Experiments show that  KISAR  is able to discover reasonable relations between input patterns and output labels, and achieves performances that are highly competitive with many state-of-the-art MIML algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, besides the performance, the stability (robustness, i.e., the variation in feature selection results due to small changes in the data set) of feature selection is received more attention. Ensemble feature selection where multiple feature selection outputs are combined to yield more robust results without sacrificing the performance is an effective method for stable feature selection. In order to make further improvements of the performance (classification accuracy), the diversity regularized ensemble feature weighting framework is presented, in which the base feature selector is based on local learning with logistic loss for its robustness to huge irrelevant features and small samples. At the same time, the sample complexity of the proposed ensemble feature weighting algorithm is analyzed based on the VC-theory. The experiments on different kinds of data sets show that the proposed ensemble method can achieve higher accuracy than other ensemble ones and other stable feature selection strategy (such as sample weighting) without sacrificing stability</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, a new unsupervised learning algorithm, namely Nonnegative Discriminative Feature Selection (NDFS), is proposed. To exploit the discriminative information in unsupervised scenarios, we perform spectral clustering to learn the cluster labels of the input samples, during which the feature selection is performed simultaneously. The joint learning of the cluster labels and feature selection matrix enables NDFS to select the most discriminative features. To learn more accurate cluster labels, a nonnegative constraint is explicitly imposed to the class indicators. To reduce the redundant or even noisy features,  l  2,1 -norm minimization constraint is added into the objective function, which guarantees the feature selection matrix sparse in rows. Our algorithm exploits the discriminative information and feature correlation simultaneously to select a better feature subset. A simple yet efficient iterative algorithm is designed to optimize the proposed objective function. Experimental results on different real world datasets demonstrate the encouraging performance of our algorithm over the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Transfer learning proves to be effective for leveraging labeled data in the source domain to build an accurate classifier in the target domain. The basic assumption behind transfer learning is that the involved domains share some common latent factors. Previous methods usually explore these latent factors by optimizing two separate objective functions, i.e., either maximizing the empirical likelihood, or preserving the geometric structure. Actually, these two objective functions are complementary to each other and optimizing them simultaneously can make the solution smoother and further improve the accuracy of the final model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Graph co-regularized Transfer Learning (GTL) for this purpose, which integrates the two objective functions seamlessly into one unified optimization problem. Thereafter, we present an iterative algorithm for the optimization problem with rigorous analysis on convergence and complexity. Our empirical study on two open data sets validates that GTL can consistently improve the classification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This study considers the problem of feature selection in incomplete data. The intuitive approach is to first impute the missing values, and then apply a standard feature selection method to select relevant features. In this study, we show how to perform feature selection directly, without imputing missing values. We define the objective function of the uncertainty margin-based feature selection method to maximize each instance’s uncertainty margin in its own relevant subspace. In optimization, we take into account the uncertainty of each instance due to the missing values. The experimental results on synthetic and 6 benchmark data sets with few missing values (less than 25%) provide evidence that our method can select the same accurate features as the alternative methods which apply an imputation method first. However, when there is a large fraction of missing values (more than 25%) in data, our feature selection method outperforms the alternatives, which impute missing values first.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents the design and learning architecture for an omnidirectional walk used by a humanoid robot soccer agent acting in the RoboCup 3D simulation environment.  The walk, which was originally designed for and tested on an actual Nao robot before being employed in the 2011 RoboCup 3D simulation competition, was the crucial component in the UT Austin Villa team winning the competition in 2011.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that robot behavior has been conceived and constructed on a real robot for the end purpose of being used in simulation.  The walk is based on a double linear inverted pendulum model, and multiple sets of its parameters are optimized via a novel framework. The framework optimizes parameters for different tasks  in conjunction  with one another, a little-understood problem with substantial practical significance.  Detailed experiments show that the UT Austin Villa agent significantly outperforms all the other agents in the competition with the optimized walk being the key to its success.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent advances in the area of compressed sensing suggest that it is possible to reconstruct high-dimensional sparse signals from a small number of random projections. Domains in which the sparsity assumption is applicable also offer many interesting large-scale machine learning prediction tasks. It is therefore important to study the effect of random projections as a dimensionality reduction method under such sparsity assumptions. In this paper we develop the bias-variance analysis of a least-squares regression estimator in compressed spaces when random projections are applied on sparse input signals. Leveraging the sparsity assumption, we are able to work with arbitrary non i.i.d. sampling strategies and derive a worst-case bound on the entire space. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets shows how the choice of the projection size affects the performance of regression on compressed spaces, and highlights a range of problems where the method is useful.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The goal in Rule Ensemble Learning (REL) is simultaneous discovery of a small set of simple rules and their optimal weights that lead to good generalization. Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions concerning the values taken by the input features. It has been shown that rule ensembles for classification can be learnt optimally and efficiently using hierarchical kernel learning approaches that explore the exponentially large space of conjunctions by exploiting its hierarchical structure. The regularizer employed penalizes large features and thereby selects a small set of short features. In this paper, we generalize the rule ensemble learning using hierarchical kernels (RELHKL) framework to multi class structured output spaces. We build on the StructSVM model for sequence prediction problems and employ a ρ-norm hierarchical regularizer for observation features and a conventional 2-norm regularizer for state transition features. The exponentially large feature space is searched using an active set algorithm and the exponentially large set of constraints are handled using a cutting plane algorithm. The approach can be easily extended to other structured output problems. We perform experiments on activity recognition datasets which are prone to noise, sparseness and skewness. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms other approaches.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many first-order probabilistic models can be represented much more compactly using aggregation operations such as counting. While traditional statistical relational representations share factors across sets of interchangeable random variables, representations that explicitly model aggregations also exploit interchangeability of random variables within factors. This is especially useful in decision making settings, where an agent might need to reason about counts of the different types of objects it interacts with. Previous work on counting formulas in statistical relational representations has mostly focused on the problem of exact inference on an existing model. The problem of learning such models is largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Counting Markov Logic Networks (C-MLNs), an extension of Markov logic networks that can compactly represent complex counting formulas. We present a structure learning algorithm for C-MLNs; we apply this algorithm to the novel problem of generalizing natural language instructions, and to relational reinforcement learning in the Crossblock domain, in which standard MLN learning algorithms fail to find any useful structure. The C-MLN policies learned from natural language instructions are compact and intuitive, and, despite requiring no instructions on test games, win 20% more Crossblock games than a state-of-the-art algorithm for following natural language instructions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent developments in reinforcement learning for non-Markovianproblems witness a surge in history-based methods, among which weare particularly interested in two frameworks, PhiMDP and MC-AIXI-CTW. PhiMDP attempts to reduce the general RL problem, where the environment's states and dynamics are both unknown, toan MDP, while MC-AIXI-CTW incrementally learns a mixture of contexttrees as its environment model. The main idea of PhiMDP is toconnect generic reinforcement learning with classical reinforcementlearning. The first implementation of PhiMDP relies on astochastic search procedure for finding a tree that minimizes acertain cost function. This does not guarantee finding theminimizing tree, or even a good one, given limited search time. As aconsequence it appears that the approach has difficulties with largedomains. MC-AIXI-CTW is attractive in that it can incrementally andanalytically compute the internal model through interactions withthe environment. Unfortunately, it is computationally demanding dueto requiring heavy planning simulations at every single time step.We devise a novel approach called CTMRL, which analytically andefficiently finds the cost-minimizing tree. Instead of thecontext-tree weighting method that MC-AIXI-CTW is based on, we usethe closely related context-tree maximizing algorithm that selectsjust one single tree. This approach falls under the PhiMDPframework, which allows the replacement of the costly planningcomponent of MC-AIXI-CTW with simple Q-Learning. Our empiricalinvestigation show that CTMRL finds policies of quality as good as MC-AIXI-CTW's on sixdomains including a challenging Pacman domain, but in an order ofmagnitude less time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A tailored model of a system is the prerequisite for various analysis tasks, such as anomaly detection, fault identification, or quality assurance. This paper deals with the algorithmic learning of a system’s behavior model given a sample of observations. In particular, we consider real-world production plants where the learned model must capture timing behavior, dependencies between system variables, as well as mode switches—in short: hybrid system’s characteristics. Usually, such model formation tasks are solved by human engineers, entailing the well-known bunch of problems including knowledge acquisition, development cost, or lack of experience. Our contributions to the outlined field are as follows. (1) We present a taxonomy of learning problems related to model formation tasks. As a result, an important open learning problem for the domain of production system is identified: The learning of hybrid timed automata. (2) For this class of models, the learning algorithm HyBUTLA is presented. This algorithm is the first of its kind to solve the underlying model formation problem at scalable precision. (3) We present two case studies that illustrate the usability of this approach in realistic settings. (4) We give a proof for the learning and runtime properties of HyBUTLA.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Network structure learning algorithms have aided network discovery in fields such as bioinformatics, neuroscience, ecology and social science. However, challenges remain in learning informative networks for related sets of tasks because the search space of Bayesian network structures is characterized by large basins of approximately equivalent solutions. Multitask algorithms select a set of networks that are near each other in the search space, rather than a score-equivalent set of networks chosen from independent regions of the space. This selection preference allows a domain expert to see only differences supported by the data. However, the usefulness of these algorithms for scientific datasets is limited because existing algorithms naively assume that all pairs of tasks are equally related. We introduce a framework that relaxes this assumption by incorporating domain knowledge about task-relatedness into the learning objective. Using our framework, we introduce the first multitask Bayesian network algorithm that leverages domain knowledge about the relatedness of tasks. We use our algorithm to explore the effect of task-relatedness on network discovery and show that our algorithm learns networks that are closer to ground truth than naive algorithms and that our algorithm discovers patterns that are interesting.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In sequence labeling, using higher order features leads to high inference complexity. A lot of studies have been conducted to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a new exact decoding algorithm under the assumption that weights of all higher order features are non-negative. In the worst case, the time complexity of our algorithm is quadratic on the number of higher order features. Comparing with existing algorithms, our method is more efficient and easier to implement. We evaluate our method on two sequence labeling tasks: Optical Character Recognition and Chinese part-of-speech tagging. Our experimental results demonstrate that adding higher order features significantly improves the performance while requiring only 30% additional inference time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A “hub” is an object closely surrounded by, or very similar to, many other objects in the dataset. Recent studies by Radovanovi´c et al. indicate that in high dimensional spaces, hubs almost always emerge, and objects close to the data centroid tend to become hubs. In this paper, we show that the family of kernels based on the graph Laplacian makes all objects in the dataset equally similar to the centroid, and thus they are expected to make less hubs when used as a similarity measure. We investigate this hypothesis using both synthetic and real-world data. It turns out that these kernels suppress hubs in some cases but not always, and the results seem to be affected by the size of the data—a factor not discussed previously. However, for the datasets in which hubs are indeed reduced by the Laplacian-based kernels, these kernels work well in ranking and classification tasks. This result suggests that the amount of hubs, which can be readily computed in an unsupervised fashion, can be a yardstick of whether Laplacian-based kernels work effectively for a given data.</p>

In this paper, a new convex matching pursuit scheme is proposed for tackling large-scale sparse coding and subset selection problems. In contrast with current matching pursuit algorithms such as subspace pursuit (SP), the proposed algorithm has a convex formulation and guarantees that the objective value can be monotonically decreased. Moreover, theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better scalability while maintaining similar or better decoding ability compared with state-of-the-art methods on large-scale problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider an infinite mixture model of Gaussian processes that share mixture components between non-local clusters in data. Meeds and Osindero (2006) use a single Dirichlet process prior to specify a mixture of Gaussian processes using an infinite number of experts. In this paper, we extend this approach to allow for experts to be shared non-locally across the input domain. This is accomplished with a hierarchical  double  Dirichlet process prior, which builds upon a standard hierarchical Dirichlet process by incorporating local parameters that are unique to each cluster while sharing mixture components between them. We evaluate the model on simulated and real data, showing that sharing Gaussian process components non-locally can yield effective and useful models for richly clustered non-stationary, non-linear data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In budget–limited multi–armed bandit (MAB) problems, thelearner’s actions are costly and constrained by a fixed budget.Consequently, an optimal exploitation policy may not be topull the optimal arm repeatedly, as is the case in other variantsof MAB, but rather to pull the sequence of different arms thatmaximises the agent’s total reward within the budget. Thisdifference from existing MABs means that new approachesto maximising the total reward are required. Given this, wedevelop two pulling policies, namely: (i) KUBE; and (ii)fractional KUBE. Whereas the former provides better performanceup to 40% in our experimental settings, the latteris computationally less expensive. We also prove logarithmicupper bounds for the regret of both policies, and show thatthese bounds are asymptotically optimal (i.e. they only differfrom the best possible regret by a constant factor).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Personal names are important and common information in many data sources, ranging from social networks and news articles to patient records and scientific documents.They are often used as queries for retrieving records and also as key information for linking documents from multiple sources. Matching personal names can be challenging due to variations in spelling and various formatting of names. While many approximated name matching techniques have been proposed, most are generic string-matching algorithms. Unlike other types of proper names, personal names are highly cultural. Many ethnicities have their own unique naming systems and identifiable characteristics. In this paper we explore such relationships between ethnicities and personal names to improve the name matching performance. First, we propose a name-ethnicity classifier based on the multinomial logistic regression. Our model can effectively identify name-ethnicity from personal names in Wikipedia, which we use to define name-ethnicity, to within 85\% accuracy.Next, we propose a novel alignment-based name matching algorithm, based on Smith–Waterman algorithm and logistic regression.Different name matching models are then trained for different name-ethnicity groups.Our preliminary experimental result on DBLP's disambiguated author dataset yields a performance of 99\% precision and 89\% recall.Surprisingly, textual features carry more weight than phonetic ones in name-ethnicity classification.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The structure of a Markov network is typically learned in one of two ways. The first approach is to treat this task as a global search problem. However, these algorithms are slow as they require running the expensive operation of weight (i.e., parameter) learning many times. The second approach involves learning a set of local models and then combining them into a global model. However, it can be computationally expensive to learn the local models for datasets that contain a large number of variables and/or examples. This paper pursues a third approach that views Markov network structure learning as a feature generation problem. The algorithm combines a data-driven, specific-to-general search strategy with randomization to quickly generate a large set of candidate features that all have support in the data. It uses weight learning, with L1 regularization, to select a subset of generated features to include in the model. On a large empirical study, we find that our algorithm is equivalently accurate to other state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting a much faster run time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Knowledge transfer is computationally challenging, due in part to the curse of dimensionality, compounded by source and target domains expressed using different features (e.g., documents written in different languages). Recent work on manifold learning has shown that data collected in real-world settings often have high-dimensional representations, but lie on low-dimensional manifolds. Furthermore, data sets collected from similar generating processes often present different high-dimensional views, even though their underlying manifolds are similar. The ability to align these data sets and extract this common structure is critical for many transfer learning tasks. In this paper, we present a novel framework for aligning two sequentially-ordered data sets, taking advantage of a shared low-dimensional manifold representation. Our approach combines traditional manifold alignment and dynamic time warping algorithms using alternating projections. We also show that the previously-proposed canonical time warping algorithm is a special case of our approach. We provide a theoretical formulation as well as experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, comparing manifold warping to other alignment methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Existing clustering methods can be roughly classified into two categories: generative and discriminative approaches. Generative clustering aims to explain the data and thus is adaptive to the underlying data distribution; discriminative clustering, on the other hand, emphasizes on finding partition boundaries. In this paper, we take the advantages of both models by coupling the two paradigms through feature mapping derived from linearizing Bayesian classifiers. Such the feature mapping strategy maps nonlinear boundaries of generative clustering to linear ones in the feature space where we explicitly impose the maximum entropy principle. We also propose the unified probabilistic framework, enabling solvers using standard techniques. Experiments on a variety of datasets bear out the notable benefit of our method in terms of adaptiveness and robustness.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Given a monochrome image and some manually labeled pixels, the colorization problem is a computer-assisted process of adding color to the monochrome image. This paper proposes a novel approach to the colorization problem by formulating it as a matrix completion problem. In particular, taking a monochrome image and parts of the color pixels (labels) as inputs, we develop a robust colorization model and resort to an augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm for solving the model. Our approach is based on the fact that a matrix can be represented as a low-rank matrix plus a sparse matrix. Our approach is effective because it is able to handle the potential noises in the monochrome image and outliers in the labels. To improve the performance of our method, we further incorporate a so-called local-color-consistency idea  into our  method. Empirical results on real data sets are encouraging.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Goal-driven autonomy (GDA) is a conceptual model for creating an autonomous agent that monitors a set of expectations during plan execution, detects when discrepancies occur, builds explanations for the cause of failures, and formulates new goals to pursue when planning failures arise. While this framework enables the development of agents that can operate in complex and dynamic environments, implementing the logic for each of the subtasks in the model requires substantial domain engineering. We present a method using case-based reasoning and intent recognition in order to build GDA agents that learn from demonstrations. Our approach reduces the amount of domain engineering necessary to implement GDA agents and learns expectations, explanations, and goals from expert demonstrations. We have applied this approach to build an agent for the real-time strategy game StarCraft. Our results show that integrating the GDA conceptual model into the agent greatly improves its win rate.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised kernel matching method to address domain adaptation problems where the source distribution substantially differs from the target distribution. Specifically, we learn a prediction function on the labeled source data while mapping the target data points to similar source data points by matching the target kernel matrix to a submatrix of the source kernel matrix based on a Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. We formulate this simultaneous learning and mapping process as a non-convex integer optimization problem and present a local minimization procedure for its relaxed continuous form. Our empirical results show the proposed kernel matching method significantly outperforms alternative methods on the task of across domain sentiment classification.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, graph-based ranking algorithms have received considerable interests in machine learning, computer vision and information retrieval communities. Ranking on data manifold (or manifold ranking, MR) is one of the representative approaches. One of the limitations of manifold ranking is its high computational complexity (O( n  3 ), where  n  is the number of samples in database). In this paper, we cast the manifold ranking into a Bregman divergence optimization framework under which we transform the original MR to an equivalent optimal kernel matrix learning problem.With this new formulation, two effective and efficient extensions are proposed to enhance the ranking performance. Extensive experimental results on two real world image databases show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Kernel methods have been successfully applied to many machine learning problems. Nevertheless, since the performance of kernel methods depends heavily on the type of kernels being used, identifying good kernels among a set of given kernels is important to the success of kernel methods. A straightforward approach to address this problem is cross-validation by training a separate classifier for each kernel and choosing the best kernel classifier out of them.  Another approach is Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), which aims to learn a single kernel classifier from an optimal  combination of multiple kernels.  However, both approaches suffer from a high computational cost in computing the full kernel matrices and in training, especially when the number of kernels or the number of training examples is very large.  In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing an efficient online kernel selection algorithm. It  incrementally learns  a weight for each kernel classifier. The weight for each kernel classifier can help us to select a good kernel among a set of given kernels.  The proposed approach is efficient in that (i) it is an online approach and therefore avoids computing all the full kernel matrices before training; (ii) it only updates a single kernel classifier each time by a sampling technique and therefore saves time on updating kernel classifiers with poor performance; (iii) it has a theoretically  guaranteed  performance compared to the best kernel predictor.  Empirical studies on image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for selecting a good kernel among a set of kernels.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Exemplar-based clustering methods have been extensively shown to be effective in many clustering problems. They adaptively determine the number of clusters and hold the appealing advantage of not requiring the estimation of latent parameters, which is otherwise difficult in case of complicated parametric model and high dimensionality of the data. However, modeling arbitrary underlying distribution of the data is still difficult for existing exemplar-based clustering methods. We present Pairwise Exemplar Clustering (PEC) to alleviate this problem by modeling the underlying cluster distributions more accurately with non-parametric kernel density estimation. Interpreting the clusters as classes from a supervised learning perspective, we search for an optimal partition of the data that balances two quantities: 1 the misclassification rate of the data partition for separating the clusters; 2 the sum of within-cluster dissimilarities for controlling the cluster size. The broadly used kernel form of cut turns out to be a special case of our formulation. Moreover, we optimize the corresponding objective function by a new efficient algorithm for message computation in a pairwise MRF. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we study the problem of large-scale Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR). A straightforward approach is to apply stochastic approximation to KLR. We refer to this approach as non-conservative online learning algorithm because it updates the kernel classifier after every received training example, leading to a dense classifier. To improve the sparsity of the KLR classifier, we propose two conservative online learning algorithms that update the classifier in a stochastic manner and generate sparse solutions. With appropriately designed updating strategies, our analysis shows that the two conservative algorithms enjoy similar theoretical guarantee as that of the non-conservative algorithm. Empirical studies on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that compared to batch-mode algorithms for KLR, the proposed conservative online learning algorithms are able to produce sparse KLR classifiers, and achieve similar classification accuracy but with significantly shorter training time. Furthermore, both the sparsity and classification accuracy of our methods are comparable to those of the online kernel SVM.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many noise models do not faithfully reflect the noise processes introduced during data collection in many real-world applications. In particular, we argue that a type of noise referred to as sparse noise is quite commonly found in many applications and many existing works have been proposed to model such sparse noise. However, all the existing works only focus on unsupervised learning without considering the supervised information, i.e., label information. In this paper, we consider how to model and handle sparse noise in the context of embedding high-dimensional data under a probabilistic formulation for supervised learning. We propose a supervised probabilistic robust embedding (SPRE) model in which data are corrupted either by sparse noise or by a combination of Gaussian and sparse noises. By using the Laplace distribution as a prior to model sparse noise, we devise a two-fold variational EM learning algorithm in which the update of model parameters has analytical solution. We report some classification experiments to compare SPRE with several related models.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many real applications, the input data are naturally expressed as tensors, such as virtual metrology in semiconductor manufacturing, face recognition and gait recognition in computer vision, etc. In this paper, we propose a general optimization framework for dealing with tensor inputs. Most existing methods for supervised tensor learning use only rank-one weight tensors in the linear model and cannot readily incorporate domain knowledge. In our framework, we obtain the weight tensor in a hierarchical way — we first approximate it by a low-rank tensor, and then estimate the low-rank approximation using the prior knowledge from various sources, e.g., different domain experts. This is motivated by wafer quality prediction in semiconductor manufacturing. Furthermore, we propose an effective algorithm named H-MOTE for solving this framework, which is guaranteed to converge. The time complexity of H-MOTE is linear with respect to the number of examples as well as the size of the weight tensor. Experimental results show the superiority of H-MOTE over state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real data sets.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Randomized first-mover strategies of Stackelberg games are used in several deployed applications to allocate limited resources for the protection of critical infrastructure. Stackelberg games model the fact that a strategic attacker can surveil and exploit the defender's strategy, and randomization guards against the worst effects by making the defender less predictable. In accordance with the standard game-theoretic model of Stackelberg games, past work has typically assumed that the attacker has perfect knowledge of the defender's randomized strategy and will react correspondingly. In light of the fact that surveillance is costly, risky, and delays an attack, this assumption is clearly simplistic: attackers will usually act on partial knowledge of the defender's strategies. The attacker's imperfect estimate could present opportunities and possibly also threats to a strategic defender.  In this paper, we therefore begin a systematic study of security games with limited surveillance. We propose a natural model wherein an attacker forms or updates a belief based on observed actions, and chooses an optimal response. We investigate the model both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we give mathematical programs to compute optimal attacker and defender strategies for a fixed observation duration, and show how to use them to estimate the attacker's observation durations. Our experimental results show that the defender can achieve significant improvement in expected utility by taking the attacker's limited surveillance into account, validating the motivation of our work.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The (Shapley-Scarf) housing market is a well-studied and fundamental model of an exchange economy. Each agent owns a single house and the goal is to reallocate the houses to the agents in a mutually beneﬁcial and stable manner. Recently, Alcalde-Unzu and Molis (2011) and Jaramillo and Manjunath (2011) independently examined housing markets in which agents can express indiﬀerences among houses. They proposed two important families of mechanisms, known as TTAS and TCR respectively. We formulate a family of mechanisms which not only includes TTAS and TCR but also satisﬁes many desirable properties of both families. As a corollary, we show that TCR is strict core selecting (if the strict core is non-empty). Finally, we settle an open question regarding the computational complexity of the TTAS mechanism. Our study also raises a number of interesting research questions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) offer a powerful modeling technique for realistic multi-agent coordination problems under uncertainty. Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and assume prior knowledge of the model. We propose a distributed reinforcement learning approach, where agents take turns to learn best responses to each other’s policies. This promotes decentralization of the policy computation problem, and relaxes reliance on the full knowledge of the problem parameters. We derive the relation between the sample complexity of best response learning and error tolerance. Our key contribution is to show that sample complexity could grow exponentially with the problem horizon. We show empirically that even if the sample requirement is set lower than what theory demands, our learning approach can produce (near) optimal policies in some benchmark Dec-POMDP problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the classic cake cutting problem where one allocates a divisible cake to  n  participating agents. Among all valid divisions, fairness and efficiency (a.k.a. ~social welfare) are the most critical criteria to satisfy and optimize, respectively. We study computational complexity of computing an efficiency optimal division given the conditions that the allocation satisfies proportional fairness and assigns each agent a connected piece. For linear valuation functions, we give a polynomial time approximation scheme to compute an efficiency optimal allocation. On the other hand, we show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of Ω 1/√ n  for general piecewise constant functions, and is NP-hard to compute for normalized functions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Equilibrium computation with continuous games is currently a challenging open task in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we design an iterative algorithm that finds an ε-approximate Markov perfect equilibrium with two-player zero-sum continuous stochastic games with switching controller. When the game is polynomial (i.e., utility and state transitions are polynomial functions), our algorithm converges to ε = 0 by exploiting semidefinite programming. When the game is not polynomial, the algorithm exploits polynomial approximations and converges to an ε value whose upper bound is a function of the maximum approximation error with infinity norm. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for equilibrium approximation with arbitrary utility and transition functions providing theoretical guarantees. The algorithm is also empirically evaluated.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Distance rationalizability is an intuitive paradigm for developing and studying voting rules: given a notion of consensus and a distance function on preference profiles, a rationalizable voting rule selects an alternative that is closest to being a consensus winner. Despite its appeal, distance rationalizability faces the challenge of connecting the chosen distance measure and consensus notion to an operational measure of social desirability. We tackle this issue via the decision-theoretic framework of dynamic social choice, in which a social choice Markov decision process (MDP) models the dynamics of voter preferences in response to winner selection. We show that, for a prominent class of distance functions, one can construct a social choice MDP, with natural preference dynamics and rewards, such that a voting rule is (votewise) rationalizable with respect to the unanimity consensus for a given distance function iff it is a (deterministic) optimal policy in the MDP. This provides an alternative rationale for distance rationalizability, demonstrating the equivalence of rationalizable voting rules in a static sense and winner selection to maximize societal utility in a dynamic process.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the problem of selecting fair divisions of a heterogeneous divisible good among a set of agents. Recent work (Cohler et al., AAAI 2011) focused on designing algorithms for computing maxsum—social welfare maximizing—allocations under the fairness notion of envy-freeness. Maxsum allocations can also be found under alternative notions such as equitability. In this paper, we examine the properties of these allocations. In particular, We provide conditions for when maxsum envy-free or equitable allocations are Pareto optimal and give examples where fairness with Pareto optimality is not possible. We also prove that maxsum envy-free allocations have weakly greater welfare than maxsum equitable allocations when agents have structured valuations, and we derive an approximate version of this inequality for general valuations.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We extend work by Christian et al. [Review of Economic Design 2007] on lobbying in multiple referenda by first providing a more fine-grained analysis of the computational complexity of the NP-complete Lobbying problem. Herein, given a binary matrix, the columns represent issues to vote on and the rows correspond to voters making a binary vote on each issue. An issue is approved if a majority of votes has a 1 in the corresponding column. The goal is to get all issues approved by modifying a minimum number of rows to all-1-rows. In our multivariate complexity analysis, we present a more holistic view on the nature of the computational complexity of Lobbying, providing both (parameterized) tractability and intractability results, depending on various problem parameterizations to be adopted. Moreover, we show non-existence results concerning efficient and effective preprocessing for Lobbying and introduce natural variants such as Restricted Lobbying and Partial Lobbying.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The complexity of the winner determination problem has been studied for almost all common voting rules. A notable exception, possibly caused by some confusion regarding its exact definition, is the method of ranked pairs. The original version of the method, due to Tideman, yields a social preference function that is irresolute and neutral. A variant introduced subsequently uses an exogenously given tie-breaking rule and therefore fails neutrality. The latter variant is the one most commonly studied in the area of computational social choice, and it is easy to see that its winner determination problem is computationally tractable. We show that by contrast, computing the set of winners selected by Tideman's original ranked pairs method is NP-complete, thus revealing a trade-off between tractability and neutrality. In addition, several known results concerning the hardness of manipulation and the complexity of computing possible and necessary winners are shown to follow as corollaries from our findings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We join the goals of two giant and related fields of research in group decision-making that have historically had little contact: fair division, and efficient mechanism design with monetary payments. To do this we adopt the standard mechanism design paradigm where utility is assumed to be quasilinear and thus transferable across agents. We generalize the traditional binary criteria of envy-freeness, proportionality, and efficiency (welfare) to measures of degree that range between 0 and 1. We demonstrate that in the canonical fair division settings under any allocatively-efficient mechanism the worst-case welfare rate is 0 and disproportionality rate is 1; in other words, the worst-case results are as bad as possible. This strongly motivates an average-case analysis. We then set as the goal identification of a mechanism that achieves high welfare, low envy, and low disproportionality in expectation across a spectrum of fair division settings. We establish that the VCG mechanism is not a satisfactory candidate, but the redistribution mechanism of [Bailey, 1997; Cavallo, 2006] is.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many real-world auctions, a bidder does not know her exact value for an item, but can perform a costly deliberation to reduce her uncertainty. Relatively little is known about such deliberative environments, which are fundamentally different from classical auction environments.  In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows us to leverage classical revenue-maximization results in deliberative environments. In particular, we use Myerson (1981) to construct the first non-trivial (i.e., dependent on deliberation costs) upper bound on revenue in deliberative auctions. This bound allows us to apply existing results in the classical environment to a deliberative environment. In addition, we show that in many deliberative environments the only optimal dominant-strategy mechanisms take the form of sequential posted-price auctions.</p>

In cooperative games, a key question is to find a division of payoffs to coalition members in a fair manner. Nucleolus is one of such solution concepts that provides a stable solution for the grand coalition. We study the computation of the nucleolus of a number of cooperative games, including fractional matching games and fractional edge cover games on general weighted graphs, as well as vertex cover games and clique games on weighted bipartite graphs. Our results are on the positive side---we give efficient algorithms to compute the nucleolus, as well as the least core, of all of these games.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We analyze symmetric protocols to rationally coordinate on an asymmetric, efficient allocation in an infinitely repeated N-agent, C-resource allocation problems. (Bhaskar 2000) proposed one way to achieve this in 2-agent, 1-resource allocation games: Agents start by symmetrically randomizing their actions, and as soon as they each choose different actions, they start to follow a potentially asymmetric "convention" that prescribes their actions from then on. We extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with N agents and C resources. We show that for any convention, there exists a symmetric subgame perfect equilibrium which implements it. We present two conventions: bourgeois, where agents stick to the first allocation; and market, where agents pay for the use of resources, and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocations. We define price of anonymity of a convention as the ratio between the maximum social payoff of any (asymmetric) strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the convention. We show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite, the market convention decreases this price by reducing the conflict between the agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Successive elimination of candidates is often a route to making manipulation intractable to compute. We prove that eliminating candidates does not necessarily increase the computational complexity of manipulation. However, for many voting rules used in practice, the computational complexity increases. For example, it is already known that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate the result of single transferable voting (the elimination version of plurality voting). We show here that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate the result of the elimination version of veto voting, of the closely related Coombs’ rule, and of the elimination versions of a general class of scoring rules.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many dynamic matching applications — especially high-stakes ones — the competitive ratios of prior-free online algorithms are unacceptably poor.  The algorithm should take distributional information about possible futures into account in deciding what action to take now.  This is typically done by drawing sample trajectories of possible futures at each time period, but may require a prohibitively large number of trajectories or prohibitive memory and/or computation to decide what action to take.  Instead, we propose to learn potentials of elements (e.g., vertices) of the current problem.  Then, at run time, we simply run an offline matching algorithm at each time period, but subtracting out in the objective the potentials of the elements used up in the matching. We apply the approach to kidney exchange.  Kidney exchanges enable willing but incompatible patient-donor pairs (vertices) to swap donors. These swaps typically include cycles longer than two pairs and chains triggered by altruistic donors.  Fielded exchanges currently match myopically, maximizing the number of patients who get kidneys in an offline fashion at each time period. Myopic matching is sub-optimal; the clearing problem is dynamic since patients, donors, and altruists appear and expire over time.  We theoretically compare the power of using potentials on increasingly large elements: vertices, edges, cycles, and the entire graph (optimum).  Then, experiments show that by learning vertex potentials, our algorithm matches more patients than the current practice of clearing myopically.  It scales to exchanges orders of magnitude beyond those handled by the prior dynamic algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In AI research, mechanism design is typically used to allocate tasks and resources to agents holding private information about their values for possible allocations. In this context, optimizing payments within the Groves class has recently received much attention, mostly under the assumption that agent's private information is single-dimensional. Our work tackles this problem in multi-parameter domains. Specifically, we develop a generic technique to look for a best Groves mechanism for any given mechanism design problem. Our method is based on partitioning the spaces of agent values and payment functions into regions, on each of which we are able to define a feasible linear payment function. Under certain geometric conditions on partitions of the two spaces this function is optimal. We illustrate our method by applying it to the problem of allocating heterogeneous items.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In large extensive form games with imperfect information, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular, iterative algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria.  While the base algorithm performs a full tree traversal on each iteration, Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) reduces the per iteration time cost by traversing just a sampled portion of the tree.  On the other hand, MCCFR's sampled values introduce variance, and the effects of this variance were previously unknown.  In this paper, we generalize MCCFR by considering any generic estimator of the sought values.  We show that any choice of an estimator can be used to probabilistically minimize regret, provided the estimator is bounded and unbiased.  In addition, we relate the variance of the estimator to the convergence rate of an algorithm that calculates regret directly from the estimator.  We demonstrate the application of our analysis by defining a new bounded, unbiased estimator with empirically lower variance than MCCFR estimates.  Finally, we use this estimator in a new sampling algorithm to compute approximate equilibria in Goofspiel, Bluff, and Texas hold'em poker.  Under each of our selected sampling schemes, our new algorithm converges faster than MCCFR.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Stackelberg security games form the backbone of systems like ARMOR, IRIS and PROTECT, which are in regular use by the Los Angeles International Police, US Federal Air Marshal Service and the US Coast Guard respectively. An understanding of the runtime required by algorithms that power such systems is critical to furthering the application of game theory to other real-world domains. This paper identifies the concept of the deployment-to-saturation ratio in random Stackelberg security games, and shows that problem instances for which this ratio is 0.5 are computationally harder than instances with other deployment-to-saturation ratios for a wide range of different equilibrium computation methods, including (i) previously published different MIP algorithms, and (ii) different underlying solvers and solution mechanisms. This finding has at least two important implications. First, it is important for new algorithms to be evaluated on the hardest problem instances. We show that this has often not been done in the past, and introduce a publicly available benchmark suite to facilitate such comparisons. Second, we provide evidence that this computationally hard region is also one where optimization would be of most benefit to security agencies, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area. Furthermore, we use the concept of phase transitions to better understand this computationally hard region. We define a decision problem related to security games, and show that the probability that this problem has a solution exhibits a phase transition as the deployment-to-saturation ratio crosses 0.5. We also demonstrate that this phase transition is invariant to changes both in the domain and the domain representation, and that the phase transition point corresponds to the computationally hardest instances.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Extensive-form games are a powerful model for representing interactions between agents. Nash equilibrium strategies are a common solution concept for extensive-form games and, in two-player zero-sum games, there are efficient algorithms for calculating such strategies. In large games, this computation may require too much memory and time to be tractable. A standard approach in such cases is to apply a lossy state-space abstraction technique to produce a smaller abstract game that can be tractably solved, while hoping that the resulting abstract game equilibrium is close to an equilibrium strategy in the unabstracted game. Recent work has shown that this assumption is unreliable, and an arbitrary Nash equilibrium in the abstract game is unlikely to be even near the least suboptimal strategy that can be represented in that space.  In this work, we present for the first time an algorithm which efficiently finds optimal abstract strategies --- strategies with minimal exploitability in the unabstracted game.  We use this technique to find the least exploitable strategy ever reported for two-player limit Texas hold'em.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Significant progress has been made recently in the following two lines of research in the intersection of AI and game theory: (1) the computation of optimal strategies to commit to (Stackelberg strategies), and (2) the computation of  correlated equilibria of stochastic games. In this paper, we unite these two lines of research by studying the computation of Stackelberg strategies in stochastic games. We provide theoretical results on the value of being able to commit and the value of being able to correlate, as well as complexity results about computing Stackelberg strategies in stochastic games. We then modify the QPACE algorithm (MacDermed et al. 2011) to compute Stackelberg strategies, and provide experimental results.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Real-world AI systems have been recently deployed which can automatically analyze the plan and tactics of tennis players. As the game-state is updated regularly at short intervals (i.e. point-level), a library of successful and unsuccessful plans of a player can be learnt over time. Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of a player’s plans, a set of proven plans or tactics from the library that characterize a player can be identified. For low-scoring, continuous team sports like soccer, such analysis for multi-agent teams does not exist as the game is not segmented into “discretized” plays (i.e. plans), making it difficult to obtain a library that characterizes a team’s behavior. Additionally, as player tracking data is costly and difficult to obtain, we only have partial team tracings in the form of ball actions which makes this problem even more difficult. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome these issues by representing team behavior via play-segments, which are spatio-temporal descriptions of ball movement over fixed windows of time. Using these representations we can characterize team behavior from entropy maps, which give a measure of predictability of team behaviors across the field. We show the efficacy and applicability of our method on the 2010-2011 English Premier League soccer data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present the first real-world benchmark for sequentially-optimal team formation, working within the framework of a class of online football prediction games known as Fantasy Football. We model the problem as a Bayesian reinforcement learning one, where the action space is exponential in the number of players and where the decision maker's beliefs are over multiple characteristics of each footballer. We then exploit domain knowledge to construct computationally tractable solution techniques in order to build a competitive automated Fantasy Football manager. Thus, we are able to establish the baseline performance in this domain, even without complete information on footballers' performances (accessible to human managers), showing that our agent is able to rank at around the top percentile when pitched against 2.5M human players.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose a natural model for agent failures in congestion games. In our model, each of the agents may fail to participate in the game, introducing uncertainty regarding the set of active agents. We examine how such uncertainty may change the Nash equilibria (NE) of the game. We prove that although the perturbed game induced by the failure model is not always a congestion game, it still admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium. Then, we turn to examine the effect of failures on the maximal social cost in any NE of the perturbed game. We show that in the limit case where failure probability is negligible new equilibria never emerge, and that the social cost may decrease but it never increases. For the case of non-negligible failure probabilities, we provide a full characterization of the maximal impact of failures on the social cost under worst-case equilibrium outcomes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce the Bayes-Adaptive Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (BA-IPOMDP), the first multiagent decision model that explicitly incorporates model learning. As in I-POMDPs, the BA-IPOMDP agent maintains beliefs over interactive states, which include the physical states as well as the other agents’ models. The BA-IPOMDP assumes that the state transition and observation probabilities are unknown, and augments the interactive states to include these parameters. Beliefs are maintained over this augmented interactive state space. This (necessary) state expansion exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, especially since each I-POMDP belief update is already a recursive procedure (because an agent invokes belief updates from other agents’ perspectives as part of its own belief update, in order to anticipate other agents’ actions). We extend the interactive particle filter to perform approximate belief update on BA-IPOMDPs. We present our findings on the multiagent Tiger problem.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (MPOMDPs) provide a powerful framework for optimal decision making under the assumption of instantaneous communication. We focus on a delayed communication setting (MPOMDP-DC), in which broadcasted information is delayed by at most one time step. This model allows agents to act on their most recent (private) observation. Such an assumption is a strict generalization over having agents wait until the global information is available and is more appropriate for applications in which response time is critical. In this setting, however, value function backups are significantly more costly, and naive application of incremental pruning, the core of many state-of-the-art optimal POMDP techniques, is intractable. In this paper, we overcome this problem by demonstrating that computation of the MPOMDP-DC backup can be structured as a tree and introducing two novel tree-based pruning techniques that exploit this structure in an effective way. We experimentally show that these methods have the potential to outperform naive incremental pruning by orders of magnitude, allowing for the solution of larger problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper presents a theoretical advance by which factored POSGs can be decomposed into local models. We formalize the interface between such local models as the influence agents can exert on one another; and we prove that this interface is sufficient for decoupling them. The resulting influence-based abstraction substantially generalizes previous work on exploiting weakly-coupled agent interaction structures. Therein lie several important contributions. First, our general formulation sheds new light on the theoretical relationships among previous approaches, and promotes future empirical comparisons that could come by extending them beyond the more specific problem contexts for which they were developed. More importantly, the influence-based approaches that we generalize have shown promising improvements in the scalability of planning for more restrictive models. Thus, our theoretical result here serves as the foundation for practical algorithms that we anticipate will bring similar improvements to more general planning contexts, and also into other domains such as approximate planning, decision-making in adversarial domains, and online learning.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Schulze's rule and ranked pairs are two Condorcet methods that both satisfy many natural axiomatic properties. Schulze's rule is used in the elections of many organizations, including the Wikimedia Foundation, the Pirate Party of Sweden and Germany, the Debian project, and the Gento Project.  Both rules are immune to control by cloning alternatives, but little is otherwise known about their strategic robustness, including resistance to manipulation by one or more voters, control by adding or deleting alternatives, adding or deleting votes, and bribery.  Considering computational barriers, we show that these types of strategic behavior are NP-hard for ranked pairs (both constructive, in making an alternative a winner, and destructive, in precluding an alternative from being a winner). Schulze's rule, in comparison, remains vulnerable at least to constructive manipulation by a single voter and destructive manipulation by a coalition. As the first such polynomial-time rule known to resist all such manipulations, and considering also the broad axiomatic support, ranked pairs seems worthwhile to consider for practical applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Supply Chain Formation (SCF) is the process of determining the participants in a supply chain, who will exchange what with whom, and the terms of the exchanges. Decentralized SCF appears as a highly intricate task because agents only possess local information and have limited knowledge about the capabilities of other agents. The decentralized SCF problem has been recently cast as an optimization problem that can be efficiently approximated using max-sum loopy belief propagation. Along this direction, in this paper we propose a novel encoding of the problem into a binary factor graph (containing only binary variables) as well as an alternative algorithm. We empirically show that our approach allows to significantly increase scalability, hence allowing to form supply chains in market scenarios with a large number of participants and high competition.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper studies repetitive negotiation over the execution of an exploration process between two self-interested, fully rational agents in a full information environmentwith side payments. A key aspect of the protocolis that the exploration’s execution may interleaves ith the negotiation itself, inflicting some degradationon the exploration’s flexibility. The advantage of this form of negotiation is in enabling the agents supervising that the exploration’s execution takes place in its agreedform as negotiated. We show that in many cases, much of the computational complexity of the new protocol can be eliminated by solving an alternative negotiation scheme according to which the parties first negotiate theexploration terms as a whole and then execute it. As demonstrated in the paper, the solution characteristics of the new protocol are somehow different from thoseof legacy negotiation protocols where the execution of the agreement reached through the negotiation is completely separated from the negotiation process. Furthermore, if the agents are given the option to control some of the negotiation protocol parameters, the resulting exploration may be suboptimal. In particular we show that the increase in an agent’s expected utility in such casesis unbounded and so is the resulting decrease in the social welfare. Surprisingly, we show that further increasingone of the agents’ level of control in some of thenegotiation parameters enables bounding the resultingdecrease in the social welfare.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Designing revenue-optimal auctions for various settings is perhaps the most important, yet sometimes most elusive, problem in mechanism design. Spiteful bidders have been intensely studied recently, especially because spite occurs in many applications in multiagent system and electronic commerce. We derive the optimal auction for such bidders (as well as bidders that are altruistic). It is a generalization of Myerson’s (1981) auction. It chooses an allocation that maximizes agents’ virtual valuations, but for a generalized definition of virtual valuation. The payment rule is less intuitive. For one, it takes each bidder’s own report into consideration when determining his payment. Moreover, bidders pay even if the seller keeps the item; a similar phenomenon has been shown in other settings with neg- ative externalities (Jehiel, Moldovanu, and Stacchetti 1996; Deng and Pekec 2011). On the other hand, a novel aspect of our auction is that it sometimes subsidizes losers when the item is sold to some other bidder. We also derive a revenue equivalence theorem for this setting. Using it, we generate a short proof of (a slight generalization of) the previously known result that, in two-bidder settings with independently uniformly drawn valuations, second-price auctions yield greater expected revenue than first-price auctions. Finally, we present a template for comparing the expected revenues of any two auction mechanisms that have the same allocation rule (for the valuations distributions at hand).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many strategic actions carry a ‘contagious’ component beyond the immediate locale of the effort itself. Viral marketing and peacekeeping operations have both been observed to have a spreading effect. In this work, we use counterinsurgency as our illustrative domain. Defined as the effort to block the spread of support for an insurgency, such operations lack the manpower to defend the entire population and must focus onthe opinions of a subset of local leaders. As past researchers of security resource allocation have done, we propose using game theory to develop such policies and model the interconnected network of leaders as a graph. Unlike this past work in security games, actions in these domains possess a probabilistic, non-local impact. To address this new class of security games, we combine recent research in influence blocking maximization with a double oracle approach and create novel heuristic oracles to generate mixed strategies for a real-world leadership network from Afghanistan, synthetic leadership networks, and a real social network. We find that leadership networks that exhibit highly interconnected clusters can be solved equally well by our heuristic methods, but our more sophisticated heuristics outperform simpler ones in less interconnected social networks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This research is motivated by large scale problems in urban transportation and labor mobility where there is congestion for resources and uncertainty in movement. In such domains, even though the individual agents do not have an identity of their own and do not explicitly interact with other agents, they effect other agents. While there has been much research in handling such implicit effects, it has primarily assumed de- terministic movements of agents. We address the issue of decision support for individual agents that are identical and have involuntary movements in dynamic environments. For instance, in a taxi fleet serving a city, when a taxi is hired by a customer, its movements are uncontrolled and depend on (a) the customers requirement; and (b) the location of other taxis in the fleet. Towards addressing decision support in such problems, we make two key contributions: (a) A framework to represent the decision problem for selfish individuals in a dynamic population, where there is transitional uncertainty (involuntary movements); and (b) Two techniques (Fictitious Play for Symmetric Agent Populations, FP-SAP and Soft- max based Flow Update, SMFU) that converge to equilibrium solutions. We show that our techniques (apart from providing equilibrium strategies) outperform “driver” strategies with re- spect to overall availability of taxis and the revenue obtained by the taxi drivers. We demonstrate this on a real world data set with 8,000 taxis and 83 zones (representing the entire area of Singapore).</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Stackelberg games increasingly influence security policies deployed in real-world settings. Much of the work to date focuses on devising a fixed randomized strategy for the defender, accounting for an attacker who optimally responds to it. In practice, defense policies are often subject to constraints and vary over time, allowing an attacker to infer characteristics of future policies based on current observations. A defender must therefore account for an attacker's observation capabilities in devising a security policy. We show that this general modeling framework can be captured using stochastic Stackelberg games (SSGs), where a defender commits to a dynamic policy to which the attacker devises an optimal dynamic response. We then offer the following contributions. 1) We show that Markov stationary policies suffice in SSGs, 2) present a finite-time mixed-integer non-linear program for computing a Stackelberg equilibrium in SSGs, and 3) present a mixed-integer linear program to approximate it. 4) We illustrate our algorithms on a simple SSG representing an adversarial patrolling scenario, where we study the impact of attacker patience and risk aversion on optimal defense policies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In many mechanisms (especially online mechanisms), a strategic agent can inﬂuence the outcome by creating multiple false identities. We consider voting settings where the mechanism designer cannot completely prevent false-name manipulation, but may use false-name-limiting methods such as CAPTCHAs to inﬂuence the amount and characteristics of such manipulation. Such a designer would prefer, ﬁrst, a high probability of obtaining the “correct” outcome, and second, a statistical method for evaluating the correctness of the outcome. In this paper, we focus on settings with two alternatives. We model voters as independently drawing a number of identities from a distribution that may be inﬂuenced by the choice of the false-name-limiting method. We give a criterion for the evaluation and comparison of these distributions. Then, given the results of an election in which false-name manipulation may have occurred, we propose and justify a statistical test for evaluating the outcome.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Peer prediction mechanisms allow the truthful elicitation of private signals (e.g., experiences, or opinions) in regard to a true world state when this ground truth is unobservable. The original peer prediction method is incentive compatible for any number of agents  n  &gt;= 2, but relies on a common prior, shared by all agents and the mechanism. The Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) relaxes this assumption. While BTS still assumes that agents share a common prior, this prior need not be known to the mechanism. However, BTS is only incentive compatible for a large enough number of agents, and the particular number of agents required is uncertain because it depends on this private prior. In this paper, we present a robust BTS for the elicitation of binary information which is incentive compatible for every  n  &gt;= 3, taking advantage of a particularity of the quadratic scoring rule. The robust BTS is the first peer prediction mechanism to provide strict incentive compatibility for every  n  &gt;= 3 without relying on knowledge of the common prior. Moreover, and in contrast to the original BTS, our mechanism is numerically robust and ex post individually rational.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the problem of predicting winners in elections given complete knowledge about all possible candidates, all possible voters (together with their preferences), but in the case where it  is uncertain either which candidates exactly register for the  election or which voters cast their votes. Under reasonable  assumptions our problems reduce to counting variants of election  control problems.  We either give polynomial-time algorithms or  prove #P-completeness results for counting variants of  control by adding/deleting candidates/voters for Plurality,   k -Approval, Approval, Condorcet, and Maximin voting rules.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The core is a central solution concept in cooperative game theory, and therefore it is important to know under what conditions the core of a game is guaranteed to be non-empty. Two notions that prove to be very useful in this context are Linear Programming (LP) duality and convexity. In this work, we apply these tools to identify games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) that admit stable outcomes. We focus on three notions of the core defined in (Chalkiadakis et al. 2010) for such games, namely, the conservative core, the refined core and the optimistic core. First, we show that the conservative core of an OCF game is non-empty if and only if the core of a related classic coalitional game is non-empty. This enables us to improve the result of (Chalkiadakis et al. 2010) by giving a strictly weaker sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the conservative core. We then use LP duality to characterize OCF games with non-empty refined core; as a corollary, we show that the refined core of a game is non-empty as long as the superadditive cover of its characteristic function is convex. Finally, we identify a large class of OCF games that can be shown to have a non-empty optimistic core using an LP based argument.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider the problem of designing automated strategies for interactions with human subjects, where the humans must be rewarded for performing certain tasks of interest. We focus on settings where there is a single task that must be performed many times by different humans (e.g. answering a questionnaire), and the humans require a fee for performing the task. In such settings, our objective is to minimize the average cost for effectuating the completion of the task. We present two automated strategies for designing efficient agents for the problem, based on two different models of human behavior. The first, the Reservation Price Based Agent (RPBA), is based on the concept of a reservation price, and the second, the No Bargaining Agent (NBA), uses principles from behavioral science. The performance of the agents has been tested in extensive experiments with real human subjects, where NBA outperforms both RPBA and strategies developed by human experts.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper addresses the problem of automated advice provision in settings that involve repeated interactions between people and computer agents. This problem arises in many real world applications such as route selection systems and office assistants. To succeed in such settings agents must reason about how their actions in the present influence people's future actions. This work models such settings as a family of repeated bilateral games of incomplete information called ``choice selection processes'', in which players may share certain goals, but are essentially self-interested. The paper describes several possible models of human behavior that were inspired by behavioral economic theories of people's play in repeated interactions. These models were incorporated into several agent designs to repeatedly generate offers to people playing the game. These agents were evaluated in extensive empirical investigations including hundreds of subjects that interacted with computers in different choice selections processes. The results revealed that an agent that combined a hyperbolic discounting model of human behavior with a social utility function was able to outperform alternative agent designs, including an agent that approximated the optimal strategy using continuous MDPs and an agent using epsilon-greedy strategies to describe people's behavior. We show that this approach was able to generalize to new people as well as choice selection processes that were not used for training. Our results demonstrate that combining computational approaches with behavioral economics models of people in repeated interactions facilitates the design of advice provision strategies for a large class of real-world settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce a new task-independent framework to model top-down overt visual attention based on graph-ical models for probabilistic inference and reasoning. We describe a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that infers probability distributions over attended objects and spatial locations directly from observed data. Probabilistic inference in our model is performed over object-related functions which are fed from manual annotations of objects in video scenes or by state-of-the-art object detection models. Evaluating over ∼3 hours (appx. 315,000 eye fixations and 12,600 saccades) of observers playing 3 video games (time-scheduling, driving, and flight combat), we show that our approach is significantly more predictive of eye fixations compared to: 1) simpler classifier-based models also developed here that map a signature of a scene (multi-modal information from gist, bottom-up saliency, physical actions, and events) to eye positions, 2) 14 state-of-the-art bottom-up saliency models, and 3) brute-force algorithms such as mean eye position. Our results show that the proposed model is more effective in employing and reasoning over spatio-temporal visual data.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A helpful teacher can significantly improve the learning rate of a learning agent. Teaching algorithms have been formally studied within the field of Algorithmic Teaching. These give important insights into how a teacher can select the most informative examples while teachinga new concept. However the field has so far focused purely on classification tasks. In this paper we introducea novel method for optimally teaching sequential decision tasks. We present an algorithm that automatically selects the set of most informative demonstrations andevaluate it on several navigation tasks. Next, we explore the idea of using this algorithm to produce instructions for humans on how to choose examples when teaching sequential decision tasks. We present a user study that demonstrates the utility of such instructions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider three hypotheses concerning the primate neocortex which have influenced computational neuroscience in recent years. Is the mind modular in terms of its being profitably described as a collection of relatively independent functional units? Does the regular structure of the cortex imply a single algorithm at work, operating on many different inputs in parallel? Can the cognitive differences between humans and our closest primate relatives be explained in terms of a scalable cortical architecture? We bring to bear diverse sources of evidence to argue that the answers to each of these questions — with some judicious qualifications — are in the affirmative. In particular, we argue that while our higher cognitive functions may interact in a complicated fashion, many of the component functions operate through well-defined interfaces and, perhaps more important, are built on a neural substrate that scales easily under the control of a modular genetic architecture. Processing in the primary sensory cortices seem amenable to similar algorithmic principles, and, even for those cases where alternative principles are at play, the regular structure of cortex allows the same or greater advantages as the architecture scales. Similar genetic machinery to that used by nature to scale body plans has apparently been applied to scale cortical computations. The resulting replicated computing units can be used to build larger working memory and support deeper recursions needed to qualitatively improve our abilities to handle language, abstraction and social interaction.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
General Game Playing (GGP) agents must be capable of playing a wide variety of games skillfully.  Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven an effective reasoning mechanism for this challenge, as is reflected by its popularity among designers of GGP agents.  Providing GGP agents with the knowledge relevant to the game at hand in real time is, however, a challenging task.  In this paper we propose two enhancements for MCTS in the context of GGP, aimed at improving the effectiveness of the simulations in real time based on in-game statistical feedback. The first extension allows early termination of lengthy and uninformative simulations while the second improves the action-selection strategy when both explored and unexplored actions are available.  The methods are empirically evaluated in a state-of-the-art GGP agent and shown to yield an overall significant improvement in playing strength.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Coordination in mixed agent-human environments is an important, yet not a simple, problem. Little attention has been given to the issues raised in teams that consist of both computerized agents and people. In such situations different considerations are in order, as people tend to make mistakes and they are affected by cognitive, social and cultural factors. In this paper we present a novel agent designed to proficiently coordinate with a human counterpart. The agent uses a neural network model that is based on a pre-existing knowledge base which allows it to achieve an efficient modeling of a human's decisions and predict their behavior. A novel communication mechanism which takes into account the expected effect of communication on the other member will allow communication costs to be minimized. In extensive simulations involving more than 200 people we investigated our approach and showed that our agent achieves better coordination when involved, compared to settings in which only humans or another state-of-the-art agent are involved.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The production of any new medicine requires solutions to many planning problems. The most fundamental of these is determining the sequence of chemical reactions necessary to physically create the drug. Surprisingly, these organic syntheses can be modeled as branching paths in a discrete, fully-observable state space, making the construction of new medicines an application of heuristic search. We describe a model of organic chemistry that is amenable to traditional AI techniques from game tree search, regression, and automatic assembly sequencing. We demonstrate the applicability of AND/OR graph search by developing the first chemistry solver to use proof-number search. Finally, we construct a benchmark suite of organic synthesis problems collected from undergraduate organic chemistry exams, and we analyze our solvers performance both on this suite and in recreating the synthetic plan for a multibillion dollar drug.</p>

We harness the ability of people to perceive and interact with visual patterns in order to enhance the performance of a machine learning method. We show how we can collect evidence about how people optimize the parameters of an ensemble classification system using a tool that provides a visualization of misclassification costs. Then, we use these observations about human attempts to minimize cost in order to extend the performance of a state-of-the-art ensemble classification system. The study highlights opportunities for learning from evidence collected about human problem solving to refine and extend automated learning and inference.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Problem-solving procedures have been typically aimed at achieving well-defined goals or satisfying straightforward preferences. However, learners and solvers may often generate rich multiattribute results with procedures guided by sets of controls that define different dimensions of quality. We explore methods that enable people to explore and express preferences about the operation of classification models in supervised multiclass learning. We leverage a leave-one-out confusion matrix that provides users with views and real-time controls of a model space. The approach allows people to consider in an interactive manner the global implications of local changes in decision boundaries. We focus on kernel classifiers and show the effectiveness of the methodology on a variety of tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Modeling visual saliency map of an image provides important information for image semantic understanding in many applications. Most existing computational visual saliency models follow a bottom-up framework that generates independent saliency map in each selected visual feature space and combines them in a proper way. Two big challenges to be addressed explicitly in these methods are (1) which features should be extracted for all pixels of the input image and (2) how to dynamically determine importance of the saliency map generated in each feature space. In order to address these problems, we present a novel saliency map computational model based on tensor decomposition and reconstruction. Tensor representation and analysis not only explicitly represent image's color values but also imply two important relationships inherent to color image. One is reflecting spatial correlations between pixels and the other one is representing  interplay between color channels. Therefore, saliency map generator based on the proposed model can adaptively find the most suitable features and their combinational coefficients for each pixel. Experiments on a synthetic image set and a real image set show that our method is superior or comparable to other prevailing saliency map models.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Current computer involvement in adolescent social networks (youth between the ages of 11 and 17) provides new opportunities to study group dynamics, interactions amongst peers, and individual preferences. Nevertheless, most of the research in this area focuses on efficiently retrieving information that is explicit in large social networks (e.g., properties of the graph structure), but not on how to use the dynamics of the virtual social network to discover latent characteristics of the real-world social network. In this paper, we present the analysis of a game designed to take advantage of the familiarity of adolescents with online social networks, and describe how the data generated by the game can be used to identify bullies in 5th grade classrooms. We present a probabilistic model of the game and using the in-game interactions of the players (i.e., content of chat messages) infer their social role within their classroom (either a bully or non-bully). The evaluation of our model is done by using previously collected data from psychological surveys on the same 5th grade population and by comparing the performance of the new model with off-the-shelf classifiers.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The pharmaceutical industry, consumer protection groups, users of medications and government oversight agencies are all strongly interested in identifying adverse reactions to drugs. While a clinical trial of a drug may use only a thousand patients, once a drug is released on the market it may be taken by millions of patients. As a result, in many cases adverse drug events (ADEs) are observed in the broader population that were not identiﬁed during clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need for continued, postmarketing surveillance of drugs to identify previously-unanticipated ADEs. This paper casts this problem as a reverse machine learning task, related to relational subgroup discovery and provides an initial evaluation of this approach based on experiments with an actual EMR/EHR and known adverse drug events.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
General Game Playing is the design of AI systems able to understand the rules of new games and to use such descriptions to play those games effectively. Games with imperfectinformation have recently been added as a new challenge forexisting general game-playing systems. The HyperPlay technique presents a solution to this challenge by maintaining a collection of models of the true game as a foundation for reasoning, and move selection. The technique provides existing game players with a bolt-on solution to convert from perfect-information games to imperfect-information games. In this paper we describe the HyperPlay technique, show how it was adapted for use with a Monte Carlo decision making process and give experimental results for its performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Locating boundaries between coherent and/or repetitive segments of a time series is a challenging problem pervading many scientific domains. In this paper we propose an unsupervised method for boundary detection, combining three basic principles: novelty, homogeneity, and repetition. In particular, the method uses what we call structure features, a representation encapsulating both local and global properties of a time series. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in detecting music structure boundaries, a task that has received much attention in recent years and for which exist several benchmark datasets and publicly available annotations. We find our method to significantly outperform the best accuracies published so far. Importantly, our boundary approach is generic, thus being applicable to a wide range of time series beyond the music and audio domains.</p>

We believe that such a tool can be used by teachers in making examinations where they need to test students on problems similar to what they taught in class, and by students in generating practice problems tailored to their specific needs. Our first insight is that we can generalize p syntactically to a query Q that implicitly represents a set of problems [[Q]] (which includes p). Our second insight is that we can explore the space of problems [[Q]] automatically, use classical results from polynomial identity testing to generate only those problems in [[Q]] that are correct, and then use pruning techniques to generate only unique and interesting problems. Our third insight is that with a small amount of manual tuning on the query Q, the user can interactively guide the computer to generate problems of interest to her. We present the technical details of the above mentioned steps, and also describe a tool where these steps have been implemented. We also present an empirical evaluation on a wide variety of problems from various sub-fields of algebra including polynomials, trigonometry, calculus, determinants etc. Our tool is able to generate a rich corpus of similar problems from each given problem; while some of these similar problems were already present in the textbook, several were new!</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The main hindrance to a widespread market penetration of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) has been their limited energy reservoir resulting in cruising ranges of few hundred kilometers unless one allows for recharging or switching of depleted batteries during a trip. Unfortunately, recharging typically takes several hours and battery switch stations providing fully recharged batteries are still quite rare – certainly not as widespread as ordinary gas stations. For not getting stranded with an empty battery, going on a BEV trip requires some planning ahead taking into account energy characteristics of the BEV as well as available battery switch stations. In this paper we consider very basic, yet fundamental problems for E-Mobility: Can I get from A to B and back with my BEV without recharging in between? Can I get from A to B when allowed to recharge? How can I minimize the number of battery switches when going from A to B? We provide efficient and mathematically sound algorithms for these problems that allow for the energy-aware planning of trips.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A key challenge in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease is matching patients to treatments that are most appropriate for them. Different cardiac assessment tools have been developed to address this goal. Recent research has focused on heart rate motifs, i.e., short-term heart rate sequences that are over- or under-represented in long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients experiencing cardiovascular outcomes, which provide novel and valuable information for risk stratification. However, this approach can leverage only a small number of motifs for prediction and results in difficult to interpret models. We address these limitations by identifying latent structure in the large numbers of motifs found in long-term ECG recordings. In particular, we explore the application of topic models to heart rate time series to identify functional sets of heart rate sequences and to concisely describe patients using task-independent features for various cardiovascular outcomes. We evaluate the approach on a large collection of real-world ECG data, and investigate the performance of topic mixture features for the prediction of cardiovascular mortality. The topics provided an interpretable representation of the recordings and maintained valuable information for clinical assessment when compared with motif frequencies, even after accounting for commonly used clinical risk scores.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a simple EM-based grammar induction algorithm for Combinatory  Categorial Grammar (CCG) that achieves state-of-the-art performance  by relying on a minimal number of very general linguistic  principles.  Unlike previous work on unsupervised parsing with CCGs,  our approach has no prior language-specific knowledge, and discovers  all categories automatically. Additionally, unlike other approaches,  our grammar remains robust when parsing longer sentences,  performing as well as or better than other systems. We believe this is a natural  result of using an expressive grammar formalism with an extended  domain of locality.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper describes a statistical approach to generation of Chinese classical poetry and proposes a novel method to automatically evaluate poems. The system accepts a set of keywords representing the writing intents from a writer and generates sentences one by one to form a completed poem. A statistical machine translation (SMT) system is applied to generate new sentences, given the sentences generated previously. For each line of sentence a specific model specially trained for that line is used, as opposed to using a single model for all sentences. To enhance the coherence of sentences on every line, a coherence model using mutual information is applied to select candidates with better consistency with previous sentences. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the BLEU metric for evaluation with a novel method of generating diverse references.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Event extraction systems typically locate the role fillers for an event by analyzing sentences in isolation and identifying each role filler independently of the others. We argue that more accurate event extraction requires a view of the larger context to decide whether an entity is related to a relevant event. We propose a bottom-up approach to event extraction that initially identifies candidate role fillers independently and then uses that information as well as discourse properties to model textual cohesion. The novel component of the architecture is a sequentially structured sentence classifier that identifies event-related story contexts. The sentence classifier uses lexical associations and discourse relations across sentences, as well as domain-specific distributions of candidate role fillers within and across sentences. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the MUC-4 data set, achieving substantially higher precision than previous systems.</p>

Sentence compression is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing,which may be of increasing interest to many applicationssuch as abstractive summarization and text simplification for mobile devices.In this paper, we present a novel sentence compression model based on first-order logic, using Markov Logic Network.Sentence compression is formulated as a word/phrase deletion problem in this model.By taking advantage of first-order logic, the proposed method is able to incorporate local linguistic features and to capture global dependencies between word deletion operations. Experiments on both written and spoken corpora show that our approach produces competitive performance against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of manual evaluation measures such as importance, grammaticality, and overall quality.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we present a simplified shallow semantic parsing approach to extracting opinion targets. This is done by formulating opinion target extraction (OTE) as a shallow semantic parsing problem with the opinion expression as the predicate and the corresponding targets as its arguments. In principle, our parsing approach to OTE differs from the state-of-the-art sequence labeling one in two aspects. First, we model OTE from parse tree level, where abundant structured syntactic information is available for use, instead of word sequence level, where only lexical information is available. Second, we focus on determining whether a constituent, rather than a word, is an opinion target or not, via a simplified shallow semantic parsing framework. Evaluation on two datasets shows that structured syntactic information plays a critical role in capturing the domination relationship between an opinion expression and its targets. It also shows that our parsing approach much outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence labeling one.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Twitter sentiment analysis (TSA) has become a hot research topic in recent years. The goal of this task is to discover the attitude or opinion of the tweets, which is typically formulated as a machine learning based text classification problem. Some methods use manually labeled data to train fully supervised models, while others use some noisy labels, such as emoticons and hashtags, for model training. In general, we can only get a limited number of training data for the fully supervised models because it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to manually label the tweets. As for the models with noisy labels, it is hard for them to achieve satisfactory performance due to the noise in the labels although it is easy to get a large amount of data for training. Hence, the best strategy is to utilize both manually labeled data and noisy labeled data for training. However, how to seamlessly integrate these two different kinds of data into the same learning framework is still a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel model, called emoticon smoothed language model (ESLAM), to handle this challenge. The basic idea is to train a language model based on the manually labeled data, and then use the noisy emoticon data for smoothing. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate that ESLAM can effectively integrate both kinds of data to outperform those methods using only one of them.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tweets have become an increasingly popular source of fresh information. We investigate the task of Nominal Semantic Role Labeling (NSRL) for tweets, which aims to identify predicate-argument structures defined by nominals in tweets. Studies of this task can help fine-grained information extraction and retrieval from tweets. There are two main challenges in this task: 1) The lack of information in a single tweet, rooted in the short and noisy nature of tweets; and 2) recovery of implicit arguments. We propose jointly conducting NSRL on multiple similar tweets using a graphical model, leveraging the redundancy in tweets to tackle these challenges. Extensive evaluations on a human annotated data set demonstrate that our method outperforms two baselines with an absolute gain of 2.7% in F1.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Social events are events that occur between people where at least one person is aware of the other and of the event taking place. Extracting social events can play an important role in a wide range of applications, such as the construction of social network. In this paper, we introduce the task of social event extraction for tweets, an important source of fresh events. One main challenge is the lack of information in a single tweet, which is rooted in the short and noise-prone nature of tweets. We propose to collectively extract social events from multiple similar tweets using a novel factor graph, to harvest the redundance in tweets, i.e., the repeated occurrences of a social event in several tweets. We evaluate our method on a human annotated data set, and show that it outperforms all baselines, with an absolute gain of 21% in F1.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Extractive style query-oriented multi-document summarization generates the summary by extracting a proper set of sentences from multiple documents based on the pre-given query. This paper proposes a novel multi-document summarization framework via deep learning model. This uniform framework consists of three parts: concepts extraction, summary generation, and reconstruction validation, which work together to achieve the largest coverage of the documents content. A new query-oriented extraction technique is proposed to concentrate distributed information to hidden units layer by layer. Then, the whole deep architecture is fine-tuned by minimizing the information loss of reconstruction validation. According to the concentrated information, dynamic programming is used to seek most informative set of sentences as the summary. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms.</p>

This paper describes an emotion-based approach to acquire sentiment similarity of word pairs with respect to their senses. Sentiment similarity indicates the similarity between two words from their underlying sentiments. Our approach is built on a model which maps from senses of words to vectors of twelve basic emotions. The emotional vectors are used to measure the sentiment similarity of word pairs. We show the utility of measuring sentiment similarity in two main natural language processing tasks, namely, indirect yes/no question answer pairs (IQAP) Inference and sentiment orientation (SO) prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively capture the sentiment similarity of word pairs and utilize this information to address the above mentioned tasks.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many natural language processing tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging, word segmentation, and etc., can be formulated as sequential data labeling problems. Building a sound labeler requires very large number of correctly labeled training examples, which may not always be possible. On the other hand, crowdsourcing provides an inexpensive yet efficient alternative to collect manual sequential labeling from non-experts. However the quality of crowd labeling cannot be guaranteed, and three kinds of errors are typical: (1) incorrect annotations due to lack of expertise (e.g., labeling gene names from plain text requires corresponding domain knowledge); (2) ignored or omitted annotations due to carelessness or low confidence; (3) noisy annotations due to cheating or vandalism. To correct these mistakes, we present Sembler, a statistical model for ensembling crowd sequential labelings. Sembler considers three types of statistical information: (1) the majority agreement that proves the correctness of an annotation; (2) correct annotation that improves the credibility of the corresponding annotator; (3) correct annotation that enhances the correctness of other annotations which share similar linguistic or contextual features. We evaluate the proposed model on a real Twitter and a synthetical biological data set, and find that Sembler is particularly accurate when more than half of annotators make mistakes.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Predicting entailment between two given texts is an important task upon which the performance of numerous NLP tasks depend on such as question answering, text summarization, and information extraction. The degree to which two texts are similar has been used extensively as a key feature in much previous work in predicting entailment. However, using similarity scores directly, without proper transformations, results in suboptimal performance. Given a set of lexical similarity measures, we propose a method that jointly learns both (a) a set of non-linear transformation functions for those similarity measures and, (b) the optimal non-linear combination of those transformation functions to predict textual entailment. Our method consistently outperforms numerous baselines, reporting a micro-averaged F-score of 46.48 on the RTE- 7 benchmark dataset. The proposed method is ranked 2-nd among 33 entailment systems participated in RTE-7, demonstrating its competitiveness over numerous other entailment approaches. Although our method is statistically comparable to the current state-of-the-art, we require less external knowledge resources.</p>

Initiated by TAC 2010, aspect-guided summaries not only address specific user need, but also ameliorate content-level coherence by using aspect information. This paper presents a full-fledged system composed of three modules: finding sentence-level textual aspects, modeling aspect-based coherence with an HMM model, and selecting and ordering sentences with aspect information to generate coherent summaries. The evaluation results on the TAC 2011 datasets show the superiority of aspect-guided summaries in terms of both information coverage and textual coherence.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The early classifications of the computational complexity of planning under various restrictions in STRIPS (Bylander) and SAS+ (Bäckström and Nebel) have influenced following research in planning in many ways. We go back and reanalyse their subclasses, but this time using the more modern tool of parameterized complexity analysis. This provides new results that together with the old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape. We demonstrate separation results not possible with standard complexity theory, which contributes to explaining why certain cases of planning have seemed simpler in practice than theory has predicted. In particular, we show that certain restrictions of practical interest are tractable in the parameterized sense of the term, and that a simple heuristic is sufficient to make a well-known partial-order planner exploit this fact.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce the Multiagent Disjunctive Temporal Problem (MaDTP), a new distributed formulation of the widely-adopted Disjunctive Temporal Problem (DTP) representation.  An agent that generates a summary of all viable schedules, rather than a single schedule, can be more useful in dynamic environments.  We show how a (Ma)DTP with the properties of minimality and decomposability provides a particularly efficacious solution space summary.However, in the multiagent case, these properties sacrifice an agent's strategic interests while incurring significant computational overhead.  We introduce a new property called local decomposability that exploits loose-coupling between agents' problems,  protects strategic interests, and supports typical queries.  We provide and evaluate a new distributed algorithm that summarizes agents' solution spaces in significantly less time and space by using local, rather than full, decomposability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In the presence of non-admissible heuristics, A<em> and other best-first algorithms can be converted into anytime optimal algorithms over OR graphs, by simply continuing the search after the first solution is found. The same trick, however, does not work for best-first algorithms over AND/OR graphs, that must be able to expand leaf nodes of the explicit graph that are not necessarily part of the best partial solution. Anytime optimal variants of AO</em> must thus address an exploration-exploitation tradeoff: they cannot just ”exploit”, they must keep exploring as well. In this work, we develop one such variant of AO<em> and apply it to finite-horizon MDPs. This Anytime AO</em> algorithm eventually delivers an optimal policy while using non-admissible random heuristics that can be sampled, as when the heuristic is the cost of a base policy that can be sampled with rollouts. We then test Anytime AO* for action selection over large infinite-horizon MDPs that cannot be solved with existing off-line heuristic search and dynamic programming algorithms, and compare it with UCT.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
It has been shown recently that the complexity of belief tracking in deterministic conformant and contingent planning is exponential in a width parameter that is often bounded and small. In this work, we introduce a new width notion that applies to non-deterministic conformant and contingent problems as well. We also develop a belief tracking algorithm for non-deterministic problems that is exponential in the problem width, analyze the width of non-deterministic benchmarks, compare the new notion to the previous one over deterministic problems, and present experimental results.</p>

In hierarchical planning, landmarks are tasks that occur on any search path leading from the initial plan to a solution. In this work, we present novel domain-independent planning strategies based on such hierarchical landmarks. Our empirical evaluation on four benchmark domains shows that these landmark-aware strategies outperform established search strategies in many cases.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce a linear distance relaxation of the n-team Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP), a simple yet powerful heuristic that temporarily "assumes"' the n teams are located on a straight line, thereby reducing the  n ( n –1)/2 pairwise distance parameters to just  n –1 variables. The modified problem then becomes easier to analyze, from which we determine an approximate solution for the actual instance on  n  teams. We present combinatorial techniques to solve the Linear Distance TTP (LD-TTP) for  n  = 4 and  n  = 6, without any use of computing, generating the complete set of optimal distances regardless of where the  n  teams are located. We show that there are only 295 non-isomorphic schedules that can be a solution to the 6-team LD-TTP, and demonstrate that in  all  previously-solved benchmark TTP instances on 6 teams, the distance-optimal schedule appears in this list of 295, even when the six teams are arranged in a circle or located in three-dimensional space. We then extend the LD-TTP to multiple rounds, and apply our theory to produce a nearly-optimal regular-season schedule for the Nippon Pro Baseball league in Japan. We conclude the paper by generalizing our theory to the  n -team LD-TTP, producing a feasible schedule whose total distance is guaranteed to be no worse than 4/3 times the optimal solution.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tractability analysis in terms of the causal graphs of planning problems has emerged as an important area of research in recent years, leading to new methods for the derivation of domain-independent heuristics (Katz and Domshlak 2010). Here we continue this work, extending our knowledge of the frontier between tractable and NP-complete fragments. We close some gaps left in previous work, and introduce novel causal graph fragments that we call the hourglass and semifork, for which under certain additional assumptions optimal planning is in P. We show that relaxing any one of the restrictions required for this tractability leads to NP-complete problems. Our results are of both theoretical and practical interest, as these fragments can be used in existing frameworks to derive new abstraction heuristics. Before they can be used, however, a number of practical issues must be addressed. We discuss these issues and propose some solutions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
UCT, the premier method for solving games such as Go, is also becoming the dominant algorithm for probabilistic planning. Out of the five solvers at the International Probabilistic Planning Competition (IPPC) 2011, four were based on the UCT algorithm. However, while a UCT-based planner, PROST, won the contest, an LRTDP-based system, Glutton, came in a close second, outperforming other systems derived from UCT. These results raise a question: what are the strengths and weaknesses of LRTDP and UCT in practice? This paper starts answering this question by contrasting the two approaches in the context of finite-horizon MDPs. We demonstrate that in such scenarios, UCT's lack of a sound termination condition is a serious practical disadvantage. In order to handle an MDP with a large finite horizon under a time constraint, UCT forces an expert to guess a non-myopic lookahead value for which it should be able to converge on the encountered states. Mistakes in setting this parameter can greatly hurt UCT's performance. In contrast, LRTDP's convergence criterion allows for an iterative deepening strategy. Using this strategy, LRTDP automatically finds the largest lookahead value feasible under the given time constraint. As a result, LRTDP has better performance and stronger theoretical properties. We present an online version of Glutton, named Gourmand, that illustrates this analysis and outperforms PROST on the set of IPPC-2011 problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent work on planning in incomplete domains focuses on constructing plans that succeed despite incomplete knowledge of action preconditions and effects. As planning models become more expressive, such as in temporal planning, the types of incompleteness may not only change, but plans become more challenging to evaluate. The primary difficulty to temporal plan evaluation is accounting for temporal constraints that may not be satisfied under all interpretations of the incomplete domain. In this work, we formulate incomplete temporal plan evaluation as a generalization of the temporal consistency problem, called partial temporal consistency. We present a knowledge compilation approach that is combined with symbolic constraint propagation and model counting algorithms for counting the number of incomplete domain model interpretations under which a plan is consistent. We present an evaluation that identifies the aspects of incomplete temporal plans most impact performance.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with factored state and action spaces, where both states and actions are described by sets of discrete variables. Prior work on SDP has considered only the case of factored states and ignored structure in the action space, causing them to scale poorly in terms of the number of action variables. Our main contribution is to present the first SDP-based planning algorithm for leveraging both state and action space structure in order to compute compactly represented value functions and policies. Since our new algorithm can potentially require more space than when action structure is ignored, our second contribution is to describe an approach for smoothly trading-off space versus time via recursive conditioning. Finally, our third contribution is to introduce a novel SDP approximation that often significantly reduces planning time with little loss in quality by exploiting action structure in weakly coupled MDPs. We present empirical results in three domains with factored action spaces that show that our algorithms scale much better with the number of action variables as compared to state-of-the-art SDP algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we consider the problem of feasibly integrating new pick-up and delivery requests into existing vehicle itineraries in a dynamic, dial-a-ride problem (DARP) setting. Generalizing from previous work in oversubscribed task scheduling, we define a controlled iterative repair search procedure for finding an alternative set of vehicle itineraries in which the overall solution has been feasibly extended to include newly received requests. We first evaluate the performance of this technique on a set of DARP feasibility benchmark problems from the literature. We then consider its use on a real-world DARP problem, where it is necessary to accommodate all requests and constraints must be relaxed when a request cannot be feasibly integrated. For this latter analysis, we introduce a constraint relaxation post processing step and consider the performance impact of using our controlled iterative search over the current greedy search approach.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Penetration Testing is a methodology for assessing network security, by generating and executing possible hacking attacks. Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing. A key question is how to generate the attacks. This is naturally formulated as planning under uncertainty, i.e., under incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses classical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty by extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to intelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would expect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies on POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed into an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network structure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where needed. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we demonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Optimal solutions to Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) usually require that there exists at least one policy that reaches the goal with probability 1 from the initial state. This condition is very strong and prevents from solving many interesting problems, for instance where all possible policies reach some dead-end states with a positive probability. We introduce a more general and richer dual optimization criterion, which minimizes the average (undiscounted) cost of only paths leading to the goal among all policies that maximize the probability to reach the goal. We present policy update equations in the form of dynamic programming for this new dual criterion, which are different from the standard Bellman equations, but produce the same solution if there exists one policy leading to the goal with probability 1 from the initial state. We demonstrate that our equations converge in infinite horizon without any condition on the structure of the problem or on its policies, which actually extends the class of SSPs that can be solved. We experimentally show that our dual criterion provides well-founded solutions to SSPs that can not be solved by the standard criterion, and that using a discount factor with the latter certainly provides solution policies but which are not optimal considering our well-founded criterion.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We introduce a highly efficient method for solving continuous partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in which beliefs can be modeled using Gaussian distributions over the state space. Our method enables fast solutions to sequential decision making under uncertainty for a variety of problems involving noisy or incomplete observations and stochastic actions. We present an efficient approach to compute locally-valid approximations to the value function over continuous spaces in time polynomial (O[n^4]) in the dimension n of the state space. To directly tackle the intractability of solving general POMDPs, we leverage the assumption that beliefs are Gaussian distributions over the state space, approximate the belief update using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and represent the value function by a function that is quadratic in the mean and linear in the variance of the belief. Our approach iterates towards a linear control policy over the state space that is locally-optimal with respect to a user defined cost function, and is approximately valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. We demonstrate the scalability and potential of our approach on problems inspired by robot navigation under uncertainty for state spaces of up to 128 dimensions.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Many real-world decision-theoretic planning problemsare naturally modeled using both continuous state andaction (CSA) spaces, yet little work has provided ex-act solutions for the case of continuous actions. Inthis work, we propose a symbolic dynamic program-ming (SDP) solution to obtain the optimal closed-formvalue function and policy for CSA-MDPs with mul-tivariate continuous state and actions, discrete noise,piecewise linear dynamics, and piecewise linear (or re-stricted piecewise quadratic) reward. Our key contribu-tion over previous SDP work is to show how the contin-uous action maximization step in the dynamic program-ming backup can be evaluated optimally and symboli-cally — a task which amounts to symbolic constrainedoptimization subject to unknown state parameters; wefurther integrate this technique to work with an efﬁcientand compact data structure for SDP — the extendedalgebraic decision diagram (XADD). We demonstrateempirical results on a didactic nonlinear planning exam-ple and two domains from operations research to showthe ﬁrst automated exact solution to these problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The cost of an optimal delete relaxed plan, known as h+, is a powerful admissible heuristic but is in general intractable to compute. In this paper we examine the problem of computing h+ by encoding it as a MAXSAT problem. We develop a new encoding that utilizes constraint generation to support the computation of a sequence of increasing lower bounds on h+. We show a close connection between the computations performed by a recent approach for solving MAXSAT and a hitting set approach recently proposed for computing h+. Using this connection we observe that our MAXSAT computation can be initialized with a set of landmarks computed by LM-cut. By judicious use of MAXSAT solving along with a technique of lazy heuristic evaluation we obtain speedups for finding optimal plans over LM-cut on a number of domains. Our approach enables the exploitation of continued progress in MAXSAT solving, and also makes it possible to consider computing or approximating heuristics that are even more informed that h+ by, for example, adding some information about deletes back into the encoding.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Finding a meaningful way of characterizing the difficulty of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is a core theoretical problem in POMDP research. State-space size is often used as a proxy for POMDP difficulty, but it is a weak metric at best. Existing work has shown that the covering number for the reachable belief space, which is a set of belief points that are reachable from the initial belief point, has interesting links with the complexity of POMDP planning, theoretically. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that the covering number for the reachable belief space (or just ``covering number", for brevity) is a far better complexity measure than the state-space size for both planning and learning POMDPs on several small-scale benchmark problems. We connect the covering number to the complexity of learning POMDPs by proposing a provably convergent learning algorithm for POMDPs without reset given knowledge of the covering number.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent work in the field of probabilistic inference demonstrated the efficiency of weighted model counting (WMC) enginesfor exact inference in propositional and, very recently, first order models. To date, these methods have not been applied to decision making models, propositional or first order, such as influence diagrams, and Markov decision networks (MDN). In this paper we show how this technique can be applied to such models. First, we show how WMC can be used to solve (propositional) MDNs. Then, we show how this can be extended to handle a first-order model — the Markov Logic Decision Network (MLDN). WMC offers two central benefits: it is a very simple and very efficient technique. This is particularly true for the first-order case, where the WMC approach is simpler conceptually, and, in many cases, more effective computationally than the existing methods for solving MLDNs via first-order variable elimination, or via propositionalization. We demonstrate the above empirically.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We describe a new sound and complete method forcompiling contingent planning problems with sensingactions into classical planning. Our method encodesconditional plans within a linear, classicalplan. This allows our planner, MPSR, to reasonabout multiple future outcomes of sensing actions,and makes it less susceptible to dead-ends. MPRS,however, generates very large classical planningproblems. To overcome this, we use an incompletevariant of the method, based on state sampling,within an online replanner. On most currentdomains, MPSR finds plans faster, although itsplans are often longer. But on a new challengingvariant of Wumpus with dead-ends, it finds smallerplans, faster, and scales much better.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The presence of non-symmetric evidence has been a barrier for the application of lifted inference since the evidence destroys the symmetry of the first-order probabilistic model. In the extreme case, if distinct soft evidence is obtained about each individual object in the domain then, often, all current exact lifted inference methods reduce to traditional inference at the ground level. However, it is of interest to ask whether the symmetry of the model itself before evidence is obtained can be exploited. We present new results showing that this is, in fact, possible. In particular, we show that both exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) and marginal inference can be lifted for the case of distinct soft evidence on a unary Markov Logic predicate. Our methods result in efficient procedures for MAP and marginal inference for a class of graphical models previously thought to be intractable.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study the marginal-MAP problem on graphical models, and present a novel approximation method based on direct approximation of the sum operation. A primary difficulty of marginal-MAP problems lies in the non-commutativity of the sum and max operations, so that even in highly structured models, marginalization may produce a densely connected graph over the variables to be maximized, resulting in an intractable potential function with exponential size. We propose a chain decomposition approach for summing over the marginalized variables, in which we produce a structured approximation to the MAP component of the problem consisting of only pairwise potentials. We show that this approach is equivalent to the maximization of a specific variational free energy, and it provides an upper bound of the optimal probability. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to previous methods.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper concerns learning and prediction with probabilistic models where the domain sizes of latent variables have no  a priori  upper-bound. Current approaches represent prior distributions over latent variables by stochastic processes such as the Dirichlet process, and rely on Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the model from data. We propose an alternative approach that searches over the domain size of latent variables, and allows arbitrary priors over the their domain sizes. We prove error bounds for expected probabilities, where the error bounds diminish with increasing search scope. The search algorithm can be truncated at  any time . We empirically demonstrate the approach for topic modelling of text documents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The paper focuses on finding the m best solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using Best-First or Branchand- Bound search. Specifically, we present m-A<em>, extending the well-known A</em> to the m-best task, and prove that all its desirable properties, including soundness, completeness and optimal efficiency, are maintained. Since Best-First algorithms have memory problems, we also extend the memoryefficient Depth-First Branch-and-Bound to the m-best task. We extend both algorithms to optimization tasks over graphical models (e.g., Weighted CSP and MPE in Bayesian networks), provide complexity analysis and an empirical evaluation. Our experiments with 5 variants of Best-First and Branch-and-Bound confirm that Best-First is largely superior when memory is available, but Branch-and-Bound is more robust, while both styles of search benefit greatly when the heuristic evaluation function has increased accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Tractable subsets of first-order logic are a central topic in AI research. Several of these formalisms have been used as the basis for first-order probabilistic languages. However, these are intractable, losing the original motivation. Here we propose the first non-trivially tractable first-order probabilistic language. It is a subset of Markov logic, and uses probabilistic class and part hierarchies to control complexity. We call it TML (Tractable Markov Logic). We show that TML knowledge bases allow for efficient inference even when the corresponding graphical models have very high treewidth. We also show how probabilistic inheritance, default reasoning, and other inference patterns can be carried out in TML. TML opens up the prospect of efficient large-scale first-order probabilistic inference.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We consider lifted importance sampling (LIS), a previously proposed approximate inference algorithm for statistical relational learning (SRL) models. LIS achieves substantial variance reduction over conventional importance sampling by using various lifting rules that take advantage of the symmetry in the relational representation. However, it suffers from two drawbacks. First, it does not take advantage of some important symmetries in the relational representation and may exhibit needlessly high variance on models having these symmetries. Second, it uses an uninformative proposal distribution which adversely affects its accuracy. We propose two improvements to LIS that address these limitations. First, we identify a new symmetry in SRL models and define a lifting rule for taking advantage of this symmetry. The lifting rule reduces the variance of LIS. Second, we propose a new, structured approach for constructing and dynamically updating the proposal distribution via adaptive sampling. We demonstrate experimentally that our new, improved LIS algorithm is substantially more accurate than the LIS algorithm.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We show that by modeling people as bounded finite automata, we can capture at a qualitative level the behavior observed in experiments. We consider a decision problem with incomplete information and a dynamically changing world, which can be viewed as an abstraction of many real-world settings. We provide a simple strategy for a finite automaton in this setting, and show that it does quite well, both through theoretical analysis and simulation. We show that, if the probability of nature changing state goes to 0 and the number of states in the automaton increases, then this strategy performs optimally (as well as if it were omniscient and knew when nature was making its state changes). Thus, although simple, the strategy is a sensible strategy for a resource-bounded agent to use. Moreover, at a qualitative level, the strategy does exactly what people have been observed to do in experiments.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In extensive-form games with a large number of actions, careful abstraction of the action space is critically important to performance. In this paper we extend previous work on action abstraction using no-limit poker games as our test domains. We show that in such games it is no longer necessary to choose, a priori, one specific range of possible bet sizes. We introduce an algorithm that adjusts the range of bet sizes considered for each bet individually in an iterative fashion. This flexibility results in a substantially improved game value in no-limit Leduc poker. When applied to no-limit Texas Hold'em our algorithm produces an action abstraction that is about one third the size of a state of the art hand-crafted action abstraction, yet has a better overall game value.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper is devoted to sequential decision making with Rank Dependent expected Utility (RDU). This decision criterion generalizes Expected Utility and enables to model a wider range of observed (rational) behaviors. In such a sequential decision setting, two conflicting objectives can be identified in the assessment of a strategy: maximizing the performance viewed from the initial state (optimality), and minimizing the incentive to deviate during implementation (deviation-proofness). In this paper, we propose a minimax regret approach taking these two aspects into account, and we provide a search procedure to determine an optimal strategy for this model. Numerical results are presented to show the interest of the proposed approach in terms of optimality, deviation-proofness and computability.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Modeling trust in complex dynamic environments is an important yet challenging issue since an intelligent agent may strategically change its behavior to maximize its profits. In thispaper, we propose a context aware trust model to predict dynamic trust by using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model an agent's interactions. Although HMMs have already been applied in the past to model an agent's dynamic behavior to greatly improve the traditional static probabilistic trust approaches, most HMM based trust models only focus on outcomes of the past interactions without considering interaction context, which we believe, reflects immensely on the dynamic behavior or intent of an agent. Interaction contextual information is comprehensively studied and integrated into the model to more precisely approximate an agent's dynamic behavior. Evaluation using real auction data and synthetic data demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in comparison with previous state-of-the-art trust mechanisms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study time-consistency of optimization problems, where we say that an optimization problem is time-consistent if its optimal solution, or the optimal policy for choosing actions, does not depend on when the optimization problem is solved.  Time-consistency is a minimal requirement on an optimization problem for the decisions made based on its solution to be rational.  We show that the return that we can gain by taking "optimal" actions selected by solving a time-inconsistent optimization problem can be surely dominated by that we could gain by taking "suboptimal" actions.  We establish sufficient conditions on the objective function and on the constraints for an optimization problem to be time-consistent.  We also show when the sufficient conditions are necessary.  Our results are relevant in stochastic settings particularly when the objective function is a risk measure other than expectation or when there is a constraint on a risk measure.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Probabilistic reasoning in the real-world often requires inference incontinuous variable graphical models, yet there are few methods for exact, closed-form inference when joint distributions are non-Gaussian.  To address this inferential deficit, we introduce SVE -- a symbolic  extension of the well-known variable elimination algorithm to perform exact inference in an expressive class of mixed discrete and continuous variable graphical models whose conditional probability functions can be well-approximated as piecewise combinations of polynomials with bounded support.  Using this representation, we show that we can compute all of the SVE operations exactly and in closed-form, which crucially includes definite integration w.r.t. multivariate piecewise polynomial functions.  To aid in the efficient computation and compact representation of this solution, we use an extended algebraic decision diagram (XADD) data structure that supports all SVE operations.  We provide illustrative results for SVE on probabilistic inference queries inspired by robotics localization and tracking applications that mix various continuous distributions; this represents the first time a general closed-form exact solution has been proposed for this expressive class of discrete/continuous graphical models.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Knowledge compilation is a powerful technique for compactly representing and efficiently reasoning about logical knowledge bases. It has been successfully applied to numerous problems in artificial intelligence, such as probabilistic inference and conformant planning. Conditioning, which updates a knowledge base with observed truth values for some propositions, is one of the fundamental operations employed for reasoning.  In the propositional setting, conditioning can be efficiently applied in all cases. Recently, people have explored compilation for first-order knowledge bases. The majority of this work has centered around using first-order d-DNNF circuits as the target compilation language. However, conditioning has not been studied in this setting. This paper explores how to condition a first-order d-DNNF circuit. We show that it is possible to efficiently condition these circuits on unary relations. However, we prove that conditioning on higher arity relations is #P-hard. We study the implications of these findings on the application of performing lifted inference for first-order probabilistic models.This leads to a better understanding of which types of queries lifted inference can address.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions is an important approach to deal with uncertainty in AI.In the theory, belief functions are defined on Boolean algebras of events.  In many applications of belief functions in real world problems,  however,  the objects that we manipulateis no more a Boolean algebra but a distributive lattice. In this paper, we extend the Dempster-Shafer theory to the setting of distributive lattices, which has a mathematical theory as attractive as in that of Boolean algebras.Moreover, we apply this more general theory to a simple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic  R ,  provide a sound and complete axiomatization for reasoning about belief functions for this logic and show that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respect to the class of the corresponding Dempster-Shafer structures is NP-complete.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study a two-player pursuit-evasion game, in which an agent moving amongst obstacles is to be maintained within ``sight" of a pursuing robot. Using a discretization of the environment, our main contribution is to design an efficient algorithm that decides, given initial positions of both pursuer and evader, if the evader can take any moving strategy to go out of sight of the pursuer at any time instant. If that happens, we say that the evader wins the game. We analyze the algorithm, present several optimizations and show results for different environments. For situations where the evader cannot win, we compute, in addition, a pursuit strategy that keeps the evader within sight, for every strategy the evader can take. Finally, if it is determined that the evader wins, we compute its optimal escape trajectory and the corresponding optimal pursuit trajectory.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A popular approach to high dimensional control problems in robotics uses a library of candidate “maneuvers” or “trajectories”. The library is either evaluated on a fixed number of candidate choices at runtime (e.g. path set selection for planning) or by iterating through a sequence of feasible choices until success is achieved (e.g. grasp selection). The performance of the library relies heavily on the content and order of the sequence of candidates. We propose a provably efficient method to optimize such libraries, leveraging recent advances in optimizing submodular functions of sequences. This approach is demonstrated on two important problems: mobile robot navigation and manipulator grasp set selection. In the first case, performance can be improved by choosing a subset of candidates which optimizes the metric under consideration (cost of traversal). In the second case, performance can be optimized by minimizing the depth in the list that is searched before a successful candidate is found. Our method can be used in both on-line and batch settings with provable performance guarantees, and can be run in an anytime manner to handle real-time constraints.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The ability to use a mirror as an instrument for spatial reasoning enables an agent to make meaningful inferences about the positions of objects in space based on the appearance of their reflections in mirrors.  The model presented in this paper enables a robot to infer the perspective from which objects reflected in a mirror appear to be observed, allowing the robot to use this perspective as a virtual camera.  Prior work by our group presented an architecture through which a robot learns the spatial relationship between its body and visual sense, mimicking an early form of self-knowledge in which infants learn about their bodies and senses through their interactions with each other.  In this work, this self-knowledge is utilized in order to determine the mirror's perspective.  Witnessing the position of its end-effector in a mirror in several distinct poses, the robot determines a perspective that is consistent with these observations.  The system is evaluated by measuring how well the robot's predictions of its end-effector's position in 3D, relative to the robot's egocentric coordinate system, and in 2D, as projected onto it's cameras, match measurements of a marker tracked by its stereo vision system.  Reconstructions of the 3D position end-effector, as computed from the perspective of the mirror, are found to agree with the forward kinematic model within a mean of 31.55mm.  When observed directly by the robot's cameras, reconstructions agree within 5.12mm.  Predictions of the 2D position of the end-effector in the visual field agree with visual measurements within a mean of 18.47 pixels, when observed in the mirror, or 5.66 pixels, when observed directly by the robot's cameras.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Saliency detection has been a desirable way for robotic vision to find the most noticeable objects in a scene. In this paper, a robust manifold-based saliency estimation method has been developed to help capture the most salient objects in front of robotic eyes, namely cameras. In the proposed approach, an image is considered as a manifold of visual signals (stimuli) spreading over a connected grid, and local visual stimuli are compared against the global image variation to model the visual saliency. With this model, manifold learning is then applied to minimize the local variation while keeping the global contrast, and turns the RGB image into a multi-channel image. After the projection through manifold learning, histogram-based contrast is then computed for saliency modeling of all channels of the projected images, and mutual information is introduced to evaluate each single-channel saliency map against prior knowledge to provide cues for the fusion of multiple channels. In the last step, the fusion procedure combines all single-channel saliency maps according to their mutual information score, and generates the final saliency map. In our experiment, the proposed method is evaluated using one of the largest publicly available image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency detection methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates. Furthermore, the proposed method is tested on a video-type test dataset where a moving camera is trying to catch up with the walking person---a salient object in the video sequence. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can successful accomplish this task, revealing its potential use for similar robotic applications.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We resolve a several-years old open question in visibility-based pursuit evasion: how many pursuers are needed to capture an evader in an arbitrary polygonal environment with obstacles? The evader is assumed to be adversarial, moves with the same maximum speed as pursuers, and is "sensed'' by a pursuer only when it lies inline-of-sight of that pursuer. The players move in discrete time steps, and the capture occurs when a pursuer reaches the position of the evader on its move. Our main result is that O( √ h   + log  n ) pursuers can always win the game with a deterministic search strategy in any polygon with  n  vertices and  h  obstacles (holes). In order to achieve this bound, however, we argue that the environment must satisfy a  minimum feature size  property, which essentially requires the minimum distance between any two vertices to be of the same order as the speed of the players. Without the minimum feature size assumption, we show that Ω &lt; ( √( n /log  n )) pursuers are needed in the worst-case even for  simply-connected  (hole-free) polygons of  n  vertices!  This reveals an unexpected subtlety that seems to have been overlookedin previous work claiming that O(log  n ) pursuers can always win insimply-connected  n -gons.  Our lower bound also shows that  capturing  an evader is inherently more difficult than just "seeing" it because O(log  n ) pursuers are provably sufficient for line-of-sight detection  even against an arbitrarily fast  evaderin simple  n -gons.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recent works on multi-agent sequential decision making using decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes have been concerned with interaction-oriented resolution techniques and provide promising results. These techniques take advantage of local interactions and coordination. In this paper, we propose an approach based on an interaction-oriented resolution of decentralized decision makers. To this end, distributed value functions (DVF) have been used by decoupling the multi-agent problem into a set of individual agent problems. However existing DVF techniques assume permanent and free communication between the agents. In this paper, we extend the DVF methodology to address full local observability, limited share of information and communication breaks. We apply our new DVF in a real-world application consisting of multi-robot exploration where each robot computes locally a strategy that minimizes the interactions between the robots and maximizes the space coverage of the team even under communication constraints. Our technique has been implemented and evaluated in simulation and in real-world scenarios during a robotic challenge for the exploration and mapping of an unknown environment. Experimental results from real-world scenarios and from the challenge are given where our system was vice-champion.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The majority of existing approaches to mobile robot mapping assumes that the world is static, which is generally not justified in real-world applications. However, in many navigation tasks including trajectory planning, surveillance, and coverage, accurate maps are essential for the effective behavior of the robot.  In this paper we present a probabilistic grid-based approach for modeling changing environments. Our method represents both, the occupancy and its changes in the corresponding area where the dynamics are characterized by the state transition probabilities of a Hidden Markov Model. We apply an offline and an online technique to learn the parameters from observed data. The advantage of the online approach is that it can dynamically adapt the parameters and at the same time does not require storing the complete observation sequences.  Experimental results obtained with data acquired by real robots demonstrate that our model is well-suited for representing changing environments. Further results show that our technique can be used to substantially improve the effectiveness of path planning procedures.</p>

This paper describes design and results of a human-robot interaction study aimed at determining the extent to which affective robotic behavior can influence participants' compliance with a humanoid robot’s request in the context of a mock-up search-and-rescue setting. The results of the study argue for inclusion of affect into robotic systems, showing that nonverbal expressions of negative mood (nervousness) and fear by the robot improved the participants' compliance with its request to evacuate, causing them to respond earlier and faster.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Sound source localization and separation with permutation resolution are essential for achieving a computational auditory scene analysis system that can extract useful information from a mixture of various sounds. Because existing methods cope separately with these problems despite their mutual dependence, the overall result with these approaches can be degraded by any failure in one of these components. This paper presents a unified Bayesian framework to solve these problems simultaneously where localization and separation are regarded as a clustering problem. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the separation quality with various setups including practical reverberant environments.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We study the symmetric rendezvous search problem in which two robots that are unaware of each other’s locations try to meet as quickly as possible. In the symmetric version of this problem, the robots are required to execute the same strategy. First, we present a symmetric rendezvous strategy for the robots that are initially placed on the open plane and analyze its competitive performance. We show that the competitive complexity of our strategy is  O ( d / R ) where  d  is the initial distance between the robots and  R  is the communication radius. Second, we extend the symmetric rendezvous strategy for the open plane to unknown environments with polygonal obstacles. The extended strategy guarantees a complete coverage of the environment. We analyze the strategy for square, translating robots and show that the competitive ratio of the extended strategy is  O ( d / D ) where  D  is the length of the sides of the robots. In obtaining this result, we also obtain an upper bound on covering arbitrary polygonal environments which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper reports on a mutual information (MI) based algorithm for automatic extrinsic calibration of a 3D laser scanner and optical camera system. By using MI as the registration criterion, our method is able to work in situ without the need for any specific calibration targets, which makes it practical for in-field calibration. The calibration parameters are estimated by maximizing the mutual information obtained between the sensor-measured surface intensities. We calculate the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound (CRLB) and show that the sample variance of the estimated parameters  empirically approaches the CRLB for a sufficient number of views. Furthermore, we compare the calibration results to independent ground-truth and observe that the mean error also empirically approaches to zero as the number of views are increased. This indicates that the proposed  algorithm, in the limiting case, calculates a minimum variance unbiased (MVUB) estimate of the calibration parameters. Experimental results are presented for data collected by a vehicle mounted with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera system.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Robotic exploration is an on-line problem in which autonomous mobile robots incrementally discover and map the physical structure of initially unknown environments. Usually, the performance of exploration strategies used to decide where to go next is not compared against the optimal performance obtainable in the test environments, because the latter is generally unknown. In this paper, we present a method to calculate an approximation of the optimal (shortest) exploration path in an arbitrary environment. We consider a mobile robot with limited visibility, discretize a two-dimensional environment with a regular grid, and formulate a search problem for finding the optimal exploration path in the grid, which is solved using A*. Experimental results show the viability of our approach for realistically large environments and its potential for better assessing the performance of on-line exploration strategies.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Indoor autonomous mobile service robots can overcome their hardware and potential algorithmic  limitations by asking humans for help. In this work, we focus on mobile robots that need human assistance at specific spatially-situated locations (e.g., to push buttons in an elevator or to make coffee in the kitchen). We address the problem of what the robot should do when there are no humans present at such help locations. As the robots are mobile, we argue that they should plan to proactively seek help and travel to offices or occupied locations to bring people to the help locations. Such planning involves many trade-offs, including the wait time at the help location before seeking help, and the time and potential interruption to find and displace someone in an office. In order to choose appropriate parameters to represent such decisions, we first conduct a survey to understand potential helpers' travel preferences in terms of distance, interruptibility, and frequency of providing help. We then use these results to contribute a decision-theoretic algorithm  to evaluate the possible choices in offices and plan where to proactively seek help. We demonstrate that our algorithm aims to minimize the number of office interruptions as well as task completion time.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In order for robots to intelligently perform tasks with humans, they must be able to access a broad set of background knowledge about the environments in which they operate.  Unlike other approaches, which tend to manually define the knowledge of the robot, our approach enables robots to actively query the World Wide Web (WWW) to learn background knowledge about the physical environment.  We show that our approach is able to search the Web to infer the probability that an object, such as a "coffee,'' can be found in a location, such as a "kitchen.''  Our approach, called ObjectEval, is able to dynamically instantiate a utility function using this probability, enabling robots to find arbitrary objects in indoor environments.  Our experimental results show that the interactive version of ObjectEval visits 28% fewer locations than the version trained offline and 71% fewer locations than a baseline approach which uses no background knowledge.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
For interaction with its environment, a robot is required to learn models of objects and to perceive these models in the livestreams from its sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model learning and real-time tracking. We extract multi-resolution 3D shape and texture representations from RGB-D images at high frame-rates. An efficient variant of the iterative closest points algorithm allows for registering maps in real-time on a CPU. Our approach learns full-view models of objects in a probabilistic optimization framework in which we find the best alignment between multiple views. Finally, we track the pose of the camera with respect to the learned model by registering the current sensor view to the model. We evaluate our approach on RGB-D benchmarks and demonstrate its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in model learning and tracking. We also report on the successful public demonstration of our approach in a mobile manipulation task.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In this paper, we address the problem of continually parsing a stream of 3D point cloud data acquired from a laser sensor mounted on a road vehicle. We leverage an online star clustering algorithm coupled with an incremental belief update in an evolving undirected graphical model. The fusion of these techniques allows the robot to parse streamed data and to continually improve its understanding of the world. The core competency produced is an ability to infer object classes from similarities based on appearance and shape features, and to concurrently combine that with a spatial smoothing algorithm incorporating geometric consistency. This formulation of feature-space star clustering modulating the potentials of a spatial graphical model is entirely novel. In our method, the two sources of information: feature similarity and geometrical consistency are fed continu- ally into the system, improving the belief over the class distributions as new data arrives. The algorithm obviates the need for hand-labeled training data and makes no apriori assumptions on the number or characteristics of object categories. Rather, they are learnt incrementally over time from streamed input data. In experiments per- formed on real 3D laser data from an outdoor scene, we show that our approach is capable of obtaining an ever- improving unsupervised scene categorization.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Homotopy classes of trajectories, arising due to the presence of obstacles, are defined as sets of trajectories that can be transformed into each other by gradual bending and stretching without colliding with obstacles. The problem of exploring/finding the different homotopy classes in an environment and the problem of finding least-cost paths restricted to a specific homotopy class (or not belonging to certain homotopy classes) arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for unpredictable entities and deployment of multiple agents for efficient exploration of an environment. In [Bhattacharya, Kumar, Likhachev, AAAI 2010] we have shown how homotopy classes of trajectories on a two-dimensional plane with obstacles can be classified and identified using the Cauchy Integral Theorem and the Residue Theorem from Complex Analysis. In more recent work [Bhattacharya, Likhachev, Kumar, RSS 2011] we extended this representation to three-dimensional spaces by exploiting certain laws from the Theory of Electromagnetism (Biot-Savart law and Ampere's Law) for representing and identifying homotopy classes in three dimensions in an efficient way. Using such a representation, we showed that homotopy class constraints can be seamlessly weaved into graph search techniques for determining optimal path constrained to certain homotopy classes or forbidden from others, as well as for exploring different homotopy classes in an environment. (This is a condensed, non-technical overview of work previously published in the proceedings of Robotics: Science and Systems, 2011 conference [Bhattacharya, Likhachev, Kumar, RSS 2011].)</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Hybrid automata networks (HAN) are a powerful formalism to model complex embedded systems. In this paper, we survey the recent advances in the application of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to the analysis of HAN. SMT can be seen as an extended form of Boolean satisfiability (SAT), where literals are interpreted with respect to a background theory (e.g. linear arithmetic). HAN can be symbolically represented by means of SMT formulae, and analyzed by generalizing to the case of SMT the traditional model checking algorithms based on SAT.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Goal recognition in digital games involves inferring players’ goals from observed sequences of low-level player actions. Goal recognition models support player-adaptive digital games, which dynamically augment game events in response to player choices for a range of applications, including entertainment, training, and education. However, digital games pose significant challenges for goal recognition, such as exploratory actions and ill-defined goals. This paper presents a goal recognition framework based on Markov logic networks (MLNs). The model’s parameters are directly learned from a corpus that was collected from player interactions with a non-linear educational game. An empirical evaluation demonstrates that the MLN goal recognition framework accurately predicts players’ goals in a game environment with exploratory actions and ill-defined goals.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
The currently dominant approach to domain-independent planning is planning as heuristic search, with most successful planning heuristics being based on solutions to delete-relaxed versions of planning problems, in which the negative effects of actions are ignored. We introduce a principled, flexible, and practical technique for augmenting delete-relaxed tasks with a limited amount of delete information, by introducing special fluents that explicitly represent conjunctions of fluents in the original planning task. Differently from previous work, conditional effects are used to limit the growth of the task to be linear in the number of such conjunctions, making its use for obtaining heuristic functions feasible. The resulting heuristics are empirically evaluated, and shown to be some- times much more informative than standard delete-relaxation heuristics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
A central component in many applications is the underlying data management layer. In Data-Web applications, the central component of this layer is the triple store. It is thus evident that finding the most adequate store for the application to develop is of crucial importance for individual projects as well as for data integration on the Data Web in general. In this paper, we propose a generic benchmark creation procedure for SPARQL, which we apply to the DBpedia knowledge base. In contrast to previous approaches, our benchmark is based on queries that were actually issued by humans and applications against existing RDF data not resembling a relational schema. In addition, our approach does not only take the query string but also the features of the queries into consideration during the benchmark generation process. Our generic procedure for benchmark creation is based on query-log mining, SPARQL feature analysis and clustering. After presenting the method underlying our benchmark generation algorithm, we use the generated benchmark to compare the popular triple store implementations Virtuoso, Sesame, Jena-TDB, and BigOWLIM.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Complexity of voting manipulation is a prominent research topic in computational social choice. The voting manipulation literature usually assumes that the manipulator is only concerned with improving the outcome of the election from her perspective. However, in practice, the manipulator may also be reluctant to lie, i.e., she may have a preference for submitting a vote that does not deviate too much from her true ranking of the candidates. In this paper, we study the complexity of finding a manipulative vote that achieves the manipulator's goal yet is as close as possible to her true preference order. We analyze this problem for three natural notions of closeness, namely, swap distance, footrule distance, and maximum displacement distance, and a variety of voting rules, such as scoring rules, Bucklin, Copeland, and Maximin. For all three distances, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for all scoring rules and Bucklin and hardness results for Copeland and Maximin.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We propose to model relative attributes that capture the relationships between images and objects in terms of human-nameable visual properties.  For example, the models can capture that animal A is 'furrier' than animal B, or image X is 'brighter' than image B.  Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images.  We show how these relative attribute predictions enable a variety of novel applications, including zero-shot learning from relative comparisons, automatic image description, image search with interactive feedback, and active learning of discriminative classifiers.  We overview results demonstrating these applications with images of faces and natural scenes.  Overall, we find that relative attributes enhance the precision of communication between humans and computer vision algorithms, providing the richer language needed to fluidly "teach" a system about visual concepts.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Game Artificial Intelligence (Game AI) is a sub-discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) that explores the ways in which AI and ML can augment player experiences in computer games. Storytelling is an integral part of many modern computer games; within games stories create context, motivate the player, and move the action forward. Interactive Narrative is the use of AI to create and manage stories within games, creating the perception that the player is a character in a dynamically unfolding and responsive story. This paper introduces Game AI and focuses on the open research problems of Interactive Narrative.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Restructuring electricity grids to meet the increased demand caused by the electrification of transport and heating, while making greater use of intermittent renewable energy sources, represents one of the greatest engineering challenges of our day. This modern electricity grid, in which both electricity and information flow in two directions between large numbers of widely distributed suppliers and generators — commonly termed the ‘smart grid’ — represents a radical reengineering of infrastructure which has changed little over the last hundred years. However, the autonomous behaviour expected of the smart grid, its distributed nature, and the existence of multiple stakeholders each with their own incentives and interests, challenges existing engineering approaches. In this challenge paper, we describe why we believe that artificial intelligence, and particularly, the fields of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are essential for delivering the smart grid as it is envisioned. We present some recent work in this area and describe many of the challenges that still remain.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Building upon previous security applications of computational game theory, this paper presents PROTECT, a game-theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the port of Boston for scheduling their patrols. USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success, and efforts are underway to test it in the port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior - to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT's efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model. Finally, in evaluating PROTECT, this paper provides real-world data: (i) comparison of human-generated vs PROTECT security schedules, and (ii) results from an Adversarial Perspective Team's (human mock attackers) analysis.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Activity planning for missions such as the Mars Exploration Rover mission presents many technical challenges, including oversubscription, consideration of time, concurrency, resources, preferences, and uncertainty. These challenges have all been addressed by the research community to varying degrees, but significant technical hurdles still remain. In addition, the integration of these capabilities into a single planning engine remains largely unaddressed. However, I argue that there is a deeper set of issues that needs to be considered -- namely the integration of planning into an iterative process that begins before the goals, objectives, and preferences are fully defined. This introduces a number of technical challenges for planning, including the ability to more naturally specify and utilize constraints on the planning process, the ability to generate multiple qualitatively different plans, and the ability to provide deep explanation of plans.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In looking back on the last five to ten years of work in heuristic search a few trends emerge. First, there has been a broadening of research topics studied. Second, there has been a deepened understanding of the theoretical foundations of search. Third, and finally, there have been increased connections with work in other fields. This paper, corresponding to a AAAI 2012 invited talk on recent work in heuristic search, highlights these trends in a number of areas of heuristic search. It is our opinion that the sum of these trends reflects the growth in the field and the fact that heuristic search has come of age.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This paper addresses the problem of automated advice provision in settings that involve repeated interactions between people and computer agents. This problem arises in many real world applications such as route selection systems and office assistants. To succeed in such settings agents must reason about how their actions in the present influence people's future actions. The paper describes several possible models of human behavior that were inspired by behavioral economic theories of people's play in repeated interactions. These models were incorporated into several agent designs to repeatedly generate offers to people playing the game. These agents were evaluated in extensive empirical investigations including hundreds of subjects that interacted with computers in different choice selections processes. The results revealed that an agent that combined a hyperbolic discounting model of human behavior with a social utility function was able to outperform alternative agent designs. We show that this approach was able to generalize to new people as well as choice selection processes that were not used for training. Our results demonstrate that combining computational approaches with behavioral economics models of people in repeated interactions facilitates the design of advice provision strategies for a large class of real-world settings.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Recently, a new language AC(C) was proposed to integrate answer set programming (ASP) and constraint logic programming (CLP). In this paper, we show that temporally expressive planning problems in PDDL2.1 can be translated into AC(C) and solved using AC(C) solvers. Compared with existing approaches, the new approach puts less restrictions on the planning problems and is easy to extend with new features like PDDL axioms. It can also leverage the inference engine for AC(C) which has the potential to exploit the best reasoning mechanisms developed in the ASP, SAT and CP communities.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) are a class of continuous optimization algorithms that have proven to perform very well on hard optimization problems. Whereas in earlier literature, both intermediate and discrete recombination operators were used, we now see that most ES, e.g. CMA-ES, use only intermediate recombination. While CMA-ES is considered state-of-the-art in continuous optimization, we believe that reintroducing  discrete recombination can improve the algorithms' ability to escape local optima. Specifically, we look at using information on the problem's structure to create building blocks for recombination.</p>

Computing similarity between short microblogs is an important step in microblog recommendation. In this paper, we investigate a topic based approach and a WordNet based approach to estimate similarity scores between microblogs and recommend top related ones to users. Empirical study is conducted to compare their recommendation effectiveness using two evaluation measures. The results show that the WordNet based approach has relatively higher precision than that of the topic based approach using 548 tweets as dataset. In addition, the Kendall tau distance between two lists recommended by WordNet and topic approaches is calculated. Its average of all the 548 pair lists tells us the two approaches have the relative high disaccord in the ranking of related tweets.</p>

Since no theoretical foundations for proving the convergence of Graph Shift Algorithm have been reported, we provide a generic framework consisting of three key GS components to fit the Zangwill&rsquo;s convergence theorem. We show that the sequence set generated by the GS procedures always terminates at a local maximum, or at worst, contains a subsequence which converges to a local maximum of the similarity measure function. What is more, a theoretical framework is proposed to apply our proof to a more general case.</p>

Active learning traditionally assumes that an oracle is capable of providing labeling information for each query instance. This paper formulates a new research problem which allows an oracle admit that he/she is incapable of labeling some query instances or simply answer "I don't know the label." We define a unified objectivefunction to ensure that each query instance submitted to the oracleis the one mostly needed for labeling and the oracle should also hasthe knowledge to label. Experiments based on different types of knowledge blind spot (KBS) models demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed design.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In case of a plan failure, plan-repair is a more promising solution than replanning from scratch. The effectiveness of plan-repair depends on knowledge of which plan action failed and why. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Extended Spectrum Based Diagnosis approach that efficiently pinpoints failed actions. Unlike Model Based Diagnosis (MBD), it does not require the fault models and behavioral descriptions of actions. Our approach first computes the likelihood of an action being faulty and subsequently proposes optimal probe locations to refine the diagnosis. We also exploit knowledge of plan steps that are instances of the same plan operator to optimize the selection of the most informative diagnostic probes. In this paper, we only focus on diagnostic aspect of plan-repair process.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multiagent Resource Allocation (MARA) distributes a set of resources among a set of intelligent agents in order to respect the preferences of the agents and to maximize some measure of global utility, which may include minimizing total costs or maximizing total return. We are interested in MARA solutions that provide optimal or close-to-optimal allocation of resources in terms of maximizing a global welfare function with low communication and computation cost, with respect to the priority of agents, and temporal dependencies between resources. We propose an MDP approach for resource planning in multiagent environments. Our approach formulates internal preference modeling and success of each individual agent as a single MDP and then to optimize global utility, we apply a market-based solution to coordinate these decentralized MDPs.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present the concept of Bayesian Tool Affordances as a solution to estimate the suitable action for the given tool to realize the given novel effects to the robot. We define Tool affordances as the “awareness within robot about the different kind of effects it can create in the environment using a tool”. It incorporates understanding the bi-directional association of executed Action, functionally relevant features of the Tool and the resulting effects. We propose Bayesian leaning of Tool Affordances for prediction, inference and planning capabilities while dealing with uncertainty, redundancy and irrelevant information using limited learning samples. The estimation results are presented in this paper to validate the proposed concept of Bayesian Tool Affordances.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
When an agent plans a sequence of actions, some unexpected events may occur during the execution of these actions. These unexpected events may prevent the agent to replan and achieve its goal.  In this work, our purpose is to recover from plan execution failures by reasoning the causes of these faulties. We combine the TLPlan forward chaining temporal planner with the PROBCOG reasoning tool in order to handle failures. It is also quite important to decide whether the failure we are dealing with is permanent. We propose that inferring some properties of the failure source helps us handle failures and determine the failure types.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) offer a formal model for planning in cooperative multiagent systems where agents operate with noisy sensors and actuators, and local information. Prevalent Dec-POMDP solution techniques have mostly been centralized and have assumed knowledge of the model. In real world scenarios, however, solving centrally may not be an option and model parameters maybe unknown. To address this, we propose a distributed, model-free algorithm for learning Dec-POMDP policies, in which agents take turns learning, with each agent not currently learning following a static policy.  For agents that have not yet learned a policy, this static policy must be initialized. We propose a principled method for learning such initial policies through interaction with the environment. We show that by using such informed initial policies, our alternate learning algorithm can find near-optimal policies for two benchmark problems.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Real-time transcription provides deaf and hard of hearing people  visual access to spoken content, such as classroom instruction, and other live events. Currently, the only  reliable source of real-time transcriptions are expensive, highly-trained experts who are able to keep up with speaking rates. Automatic speech recognition is cheaper but produces too many errors in realistic settings. We introduce a new approach in which partial captions from multiple non-experts are combined to produce a high-quality transcription in real-time. We demonstrate the potential of this approach with data collected from 20 non-expert captionists.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Planning is vital to a wide range of domains, including robotics,  military strategy, logistics, itinerary generation and more, that both humans and  computers find difficult. Collaborative planning holds the promise of greatly improving performance on these tasks by leveraging the strengths of both humans and automated planners. However, this requires formalizing the problem domain and input, which must be done by hand, a priori, restricting its use in general real-world domains. We propose using a real-time crowd of workers to simultaneously solve the planning problem, formalize the domain, and train an automated system. As plans are developed, the system is able to learn the domain, and contribute larger segments of work.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
As growing numbers of real world applications involve imbalanced class distribution or unequal costs for mis- classification errors in different classes, learning from imbalanced class distribution is considered to be one of the most challenging issues in data mining research. This study empirically investigates the sensitivity of bagging predictors with respect to 12 algorithms and 9 levels of class distribution on 14 imbalanced data-sets by using statistical and graphical methods to address the important issue of understanding the effect of vary- ing levels of class distribution on bagging predictors. The experimental results demonstrate that bagging NB and MLP are insensitive to various levels of imbalanced class distribution.</p>

Geotagged photos of users on social media site, i.e., Flickr provide plentiful location-based data, which has been exploited for location-based services, such as mapping geotags to places and recommendation of personalized landmarks. As users&rsquo; preferences to visit a location or multiple locations in a certain sequence could be affected by their current temporal, and weather context. This paper considers the problem of mining context-aware significant semantic travel sequences from geotagged photos.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Human-agent interaction for learning with instruction canbe viewed on a continuum of instructor/agent control. At one extreme are systems that learn by instructor-driveninteractions, such as learning by demonstration, examples,or imitation. The other extreme of the continuum isoccupied by systems where instructor interaction is limited to responding to the questions posed by the agent or toproviding feedback on agent’s performance. There are advantages to an approach that explores a mixed-initiative instructional dialog. We describe an approach to mixed-initiative interaction based on collaborative discourse theory that allows Soar agents to learn from situated instruction.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In recent times, crowdsourcing over social networks has emerged as an active tool for complex task execution. In this paper, we address the problem faced by a planner to incentivize agents in the network to execute a task and also help in recruiting other agents for this purpose. We study this mechanism design problem under two natural resource optimization settings: (1) cost critical tasks, where the planner's goal is to minimize the total cost, and (2) time critical tasks, where the goal is to minimize the total time elapsed before the task is executed. We define a set of fairness properties that should be ideally satisfied by a crowdsourcing mechanism. We prove that no mechanism can satisfy all these properties simultaneously. We relax some of these properties and define their approximate counterparts. Under appropriate approximate fairness criteria, we obtain a non-trivial family of payment mechanisms. Moreover, we provide precise characterizations of cost critical and time critical mechanisms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Clustering ensemble mainly relies on the pairwise similarity to capture the consensus function. However, it usually considers each base clustering independently, and treats the similarity measure roughly with either 0 or 1. To address these two issues, we propose a coupled framework of clustering ensembles CCE, and exemplify it with the coupled version CCSPA for CSPA. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CCSPA over baseline approaches in terms of the clustering accuracy.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We are developing a testbed for learning by demonstration combining spoken language and sensor data in a natural real-world environment. Microsoft Kinect RGB-Depth cameras allow us to infer high-level visual features, such as the relative position of objects in space, with greater precision and less training than required by traditional systems. Speech is recognized and parsed using a “deep” parsing system, so that language features are available at the word, syntactic, and semantic levels. We collected an initial data set of 10 episodes of 7 individuals demonstrating how to “make tea”, and created a “gold standard” hand annotation of the actions performed in each. Finally, we are constructing “baseline” HMM-based activity recognition models using the visual and language features, in order to be ready to evaluate the performance of our future work on deeper and more structured models.</p>

This paper presents an abstract for a general data transformation approach. Using programming by demonstration technique, we learn the transformation rules through user given examples. These transformation rules are automatically generated from a predefined grammar. Due to the grammar space is huge, we propose a grammar space reduction method to reduce the search space and a sketch of search algorithm is adopted to identify the rules that are consistent with the examples. The final experimental results show our approach achieves promising results on different transformation scenarios.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Key challenges to widespread deployment of mobile robots to interact with humans in real-world domains include the ability to: (a) robustly represent and revise domain knowledge; (b) autonomously adapt sensing and processing to the task at hand; and (c) learn from unreliable high-level human feedback. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been used to plan sensing and navigation in different application domains. It is however a challenge to include common sense knowledge obtained from sensory or human inputs in POMDPs. In addition, information extracted from sensory and human inputs may have varying levels of relevance to current and future tasks. On the other hand, although a non-monotonic logic programming paradigm such as Answer Set Programming (ASP) is wellsuited for common sense reasoning, it is unable to model the uncertainty in real-world sensing and navigation (Gelfond 2008). This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates ASP, hierarchical POMDPs (Zhang and Sridharan 2012) and psychophysics principles to address the challenges stated above. Experimental results in simulation and on mobile robots deployed in indoor domains show that the framework results in reliable and efficient operation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Groups of robots are often able to to accomplish missions that no single robot can achieve by themselves. Teamwork is a very important factor in complex, dynamic domains. In heterogeneous teams, robustness and flexibility are increased by the diversity of the robots, each contributing different capabilities. In such heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems it is reasonable to explicitly take the robots' capabilities into account when determining which one is best suited for a task. In this paper I present a framework that formalizes robots' capabilities and provides a means to estimate their suitability for a task. In highly unpredictable domains, accurate predictions of the outcomes of a robot's actions are virtually impossible. Approximate models and algorithms are required which help to estimate the outcome with highest possible confidence. The proposed architecture can provide estimates of task solution qualities at three levels of confidence: the lowest level only taking the mere existence of capabilities into account, the middle level considering task-specific details with approximate parameters of the capabilities, and the highest confidence level considering more elaborate planning algorithms.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Heuristic search is a technique used pervasively in the fieldsof artificial intelligence, automated planning and operations research to solve a wide range of problems from planning military deployments to planning tasks for a robot that must clean a messy kitchen. An automated agent can use heuristic search to construct a plan that, when executed, will achieve a desired task. The search algorithm explores different sequences of actions that the agent can execute, looking for a sequence that will lead it to a desired goal state. In many situations, an agent is given a task that it would like to solve as quickly as possible. The agent must allocate its time between searching for the actions that will achieve the task and actually executing them. We call this problem planning under time pressure.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Businesses deploy chatter bots to engage in text-based conversations with customers that are intended resolve their issues. However, these chatter bots are only effective in exchanges consisting of question-answer pairs, where the context may switch with every pair. I am designing a semantic architecture that enables chatter bots to hold short conversations, where context is maintained throughout the exchange. I leverage specific ideas from conversation theory, speech acts theory, and knowledge representation. My architecture models a conversation as a stochastic process that flows through a set of states. The main contribution of this work is that it analyses and models the semantics of conversations as entities, instead of lower level grammatical and linguistics forms. I evaluate the performance of the architecture in accordance with Grice’s cooperative maxims, which form the central idea in the theory of pragmatics.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
My research seeks to answer the question of how any agent that is tasked with making sense of its world, by finding explanations for evidence (e.g., sensor reports) using domain-general strategies, may accurately and efficiently handle incomplete evidence, noisy evidence, and an incomplete knowledge base. I propose the following answer to the question. The agent should employ an optimal abductive reasoning algorithm (developed piece-wise and shown to be best in a class of similar algorithms) that allows it to reason from evidence to causes. For the sake of efficiency and operational concerns, the agent should establish beliefs periodically rather than waiting until it has obtained all evidence it will ever be able to obtain. If the agent commits to beliefs on the basis of incomplete or noisy evidence or an incomplete knowledge base, these beliefs may be incorrect. Future evidence obtained by the agent may result in failed predictions or anomalies. The agent is then tasked with determining whether it should retain its beliefs and therefore discount the newly-obtained evidence, revise its prior beliefs, or expand its knowledge base (what can be described as anomaly-driven or explanation-based learning). I have developed an abductive metareasoning procedure that aims to appropriately reason about these situations. Preliminary experiments in two reasoning tasks indicate that the procedure is effective.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Multiagent resource allocation under uncertainty raises various computational challenges in terms of efficiency such as intractability, communication cost, and preference representation. To date most approaches do not provide efficient solutions for dynamic environments where temporal constraints pose particular challenges. We propose two techniques to cope with such settings: auctions to allocate fairly according to preferences, and MDPs to address stochasticity. This research seeks to determine the ideal combination between the two methods to handle wide range of allocation problems with reduced computation and communication cost between agents.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
In a dynamic environment, an intelligent agent must consider unexpected changes to the world and plan for them. We aim to address this key issue by building more robust artificial agents through the generalization of plan representations. Our research focuses on the process of generalizing various plan forms and the development of a compact representation which embodies a generalized plan as a policy. Our techniques allow an agent to execute efficiently in an online setting. We have, to date, demonstrated our approach for sequential and partial order plans and are pursuing similar techniques for representations such as Hierarchical Task Networks and GOLOG programs</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Much work in learning from demonstration has focused on learning simple tasks from structured demonstrations that have a well-defined beginning and end. As we attempt to scale robot learning to increasingly complex tasks, it becomes intractable to learn task policies monolithically. Furthermore, it is desirable to be able to learn from natural, unstructured demonstrations, which are unsegmented, possibly incomplete, and may come from different tasks. We propose a three-part approach to designing a natural, scalable system that allows a robot to learn tasks of increasing complexity by automatically building and refining a library of skills over time. First, we describe a Bayesian nonparametric model that can segment unstructured demonstrations into appropriate numbers of component skills and recognize repeated skills across demonstrations and tasks. These skills can then be parameterized and generalized to new situations. Second, we propose to create a system that allows the user to provide unstructured corrections and feedback to the robot, without requiring any knowledge of the robot's underlying representation of the task or its component skills. Third, we propose to infer the user's intentions for each segmented skill and autonomously improve these skills using reinforcement learning. This approach will be applied to learn and generalize complex, multi-step tasks that are beyond the reach of current LfD methods, using the PR2 mobile manipulator as a testing platform.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
This research proposes the use of imitation based learning to build collaborative strategies for a team of agents. Imitation based learning involves learning from an expert by observing her demonstrating a task and then replicating it. This mechanism makes it extremely easy for a knowledge engineer to transfer knowledge to a software agent via human demonstrations. This research aims to apply imitation to learn not only the strategy of an individual agent but also the collaborative strategy of a team of agents to achieve a common goal. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is being assessed in the domain of RoboCup Soccer Simulation 3D which is a promising platform to address many of the complex real-world problems and offers a truly dynamic, stochastic, and partially-observable environment.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
Virtual worlds present a challenge for intelligent mobile agents. They are required to generate maps of very large scale, dynamic and unstructured environments in a short amount of time. We investigate how to represent maps of ever growing virtual environments, how the agent can build, update and use these maps to navigate between points in the environment. We look at trails, the movement of other people and agents in the environment as a new information source. We can use trails to improve the generation of probabilistic roadmaps in these environments and enable the agent to segment space intelligently. Our future plans are to extend this to look at dynamic environments, where the agent will have to recognise change and update the map and how this will affect the map representation.</p>

<p>【Abstract】:
We present a study of how humans represent space when solving Tower Defense puzzles, a complex spatial reasoning task requiring the subject to protect locations by arranging a set of defense towers at strategic positions. We have discovered that the representation humans use is significantly more complex than what is needed to describe the spatial situation. Strategy and spatial representations are tightly intertwined with spatial representations forgoing objective, atomically-defined spatial features for context-sensitive, goal-oriented spatial affordances. Spatial relationships exist not only between objects but between an object’s properties, second-order properties, joint spatial properties and temporal properties.</p>
